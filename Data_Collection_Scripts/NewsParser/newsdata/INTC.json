For such buyers, analysts yesterday recommended purchase of the Intel Corporation's battered shares after I.B.M. said that it had stopped shipments of personal computers using Intel's flagship Pentium microprocessor. Intel shares fell $4.50, to $58.25, before trading was halted at Intel's request for more than two hours so that it could respond to the International Business Machines Corporation's announcement. I.B.M. said it had stopped shipments because its internal research showed that a flaw in the Pentium would cause math errors far more often than Intel had acknowledged last month, when the problem was first disclosed.","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Market Place; For some buyers, analysts see Intel as an opportunity."},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"MARKET PLACE (TIMES COLUMN)TICKER: INTC (NASDAQ)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP (IBM) INTEL CORP"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"COMPANY: INTEL CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INTEL CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTER CHIPS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INVESTMENT STRATEGIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PERSONAL COMPUTERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"DATA PROCESSING (COMPUTERS)"}],"pub_date":"1994-12-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Technology; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By Lawrence M.
