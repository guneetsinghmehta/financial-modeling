Even the artist himself is something of a mystery. Mu Xin is not his real name. He is best known as a writer, not as a painter. His landscapes are complex and arcane in technique. And although they were all produced when he was imprisoned as a political dissident in the 1970's, he denies that they are political art and asks that they be considered without reference to biographical facts.","abstract":"Holland Cotter reviews landscape paintings by artist Mu Xin at Asia Society; photos (M)","print_page":"31","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Captive Visions Flourish Amid a Delicate Secrecy","kicker":"ART REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MU XIN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ASIA SOCIETY"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2003-06-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Leisure\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Holland","rank":1,"lastname":"COTTER"}],"original":"By HOLLAND COTTER"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd275758eb7c8105d834eff","word_count":1180,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/01\/08\/world\/crackdown-talk-eased-by-beijing.html","snippet":"In the clearest sign so far of the Government's changing position on the army crackdown in June 1989, China's chief spokesman has said he hopes people will forget the matter.    \"I don't much want to mention it -- that June 4 disturbance -- and I ...","lead_paragraph":"In the clearest sign so far of the Government's changing position on the army crackdown in June 1989, China's chief spokesman has said he hopes people will forget the matter. \"I don't much want to mention it -- that June 4 disturbance -- and I hope people gradually forget it,\" said the chief spokesman, Yuan Mu, in an interview with Chinese television broadcast on Sunday night.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"CRACKDOWN TALK EASED BY BEIJING"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"YUAN MU"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CHINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEMONSTRATIONS AND RIOTS"}],"pub_date":"1991-01-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By NICHOLAS D.

It's not as if he pulls up his shirt to show some surgeon's stitching. Mr. Mu, a large, soft-spoken man seated at the gleaming black conference table in the headquarters of his diversified international company, is much too sophisticated for that. But like many capitalists in China, he is prodded by memories that run rather deeper than a Western executive's indignation at some analyst's sell recommendation.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Tycoon Named Mu: Product of Old China Leading the New"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MU QIZHONG"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CHINA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"LAND ECONOMIC GROUP"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ENTREPRENEURSHIP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1992-08-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By NICHOLAS D.
