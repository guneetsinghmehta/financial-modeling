In 2016, <strong>HP Inc.</strong> ( HPQ ) stated that it aims to reinvent the printing experience and unveiled the worlds smallest all-in-one inkjet printer in fiscal 3Q16. In May 2016, HP announced the worlds first production-ready 3D printer. In 2016, HP announced that it was working with a number of strategic partners, including <strong>Nike</strong> ( NKE ), BMW, <strong>Autodesk</strong> ( ADSK ), <strong>Jabil</strong> ( JBL ), <strong>Johnson Johnson</strong> ( JNJ ), and <strong>Siemens</strong> ( SIEGY ) in the 3D Printing space. HPQ also launched demo units for customers. In September 2016, HP stated that it intended to acquire <strong>Samsungs</strong> ( SSNLF ) printer business in a deal valued at $1.1 billion. HP is looking to disrupt the printer space using MFP (multifunction printer) technology.

HP values the worldwide A3 copiers segment at $55 billion and expects the transaction to close in the second half of calendar 2017.

According to HP, it will be able to address ~77% of the 3D plastic market, which will drive revenue significantly over the next few years. In June 2016, HP announced that it had acquired German-based ( FGM ) David 3D Solutions. The acquisition has provided HPQ with the technology to continue to evolve Sprout 3D and advance its market opportunities in both Immersive Computing and the $7 billion 3D scanning market. Notably, HP wants to build an end-to-end 3D solutions ecosystem, and it believes that its acquisition of David will bring it one step closer to this goal. Quote data by <strong>Xignite</strong>
