<p>Shares of <strong>AT T</strong> ( T ) today rose 13 cents to $41.25, after the company announced late in the afternoon that it will offer unlimited data to post-paid wireless customers for $100 per month, for $180 for four lines. Technically, this is <strong>AT T</strong> &ldquo;expanding&rdquo; its unlimited service; the company had been offering an unlimited data plan as a bundle for those customers who use its video services. But <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> &nbsp;analyst&nbsp; Jennifer Fritzsche points out this evening that T was the last to not offer unlimited as a stand-alone option for wireless customers, after <strong>Verizon Communications</strong> ( VZ ) announced a plan last weekend . (Those of us who have been <strong>AT T</strong> customers, including yours truly, can remember holding onto our existing unlimited plans for years since it was formally discontinued.) Fritzsche, who has an Outperform rating on <strong>AT T</strong> shares, writes that Blinking moment has indeed occurred! It&rsquo;s a big sign of how things have changed in the business that <strong>AT T</strong> is abandoning its hold-out status on pricing: <strong>AT T</strong> clearly is jumping into the unlimited game in a bigger way. T was the last of the Big 4 wireless carrier to not offer an unlimited wireless data plan standalone, though it did offer unlimited when bundled with a video product prior. Today s news changes that. T made a very purposeful move to move away from standalone unlimited wireless plans in recent years. In fact, the last time it offered a standalone wireless plan was in 2010. We believe this move was more reactionary to VZ s move Sunday given that it is a clear premium to both TMUS and S. That said, this move highlights the competitive state of the industry as T in recent years had been the one carrier most to toe the line in pricing.
