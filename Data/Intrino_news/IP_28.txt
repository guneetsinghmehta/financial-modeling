Segment Performance Industrial Packaging: Sales from this segment declined to $3,559 million from $3,595 million in the year-ago period.

Operating profit for the segment was $121 million versus $130 million in the year-ago quarter due to higher maintenance outage costs, seasonally higher operating costs and an unfavorable product mix.
