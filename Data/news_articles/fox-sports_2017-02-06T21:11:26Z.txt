One of Manchester United s brightest young prospects, 21-year-old Andreas Pereira, is currently out on loan at Granada in Spain s La Liga. There s no telling if he ll have a spot in the United first team next year when he returns. But, if he keeps pulling off efforts like this one, there s a solid chance Jose Mourinho will at least hand him a chance to prove himself. This is what your boy @andrinhopereira did while out on loan tonight, #MUFC fans ☄️ https://t.co/6EBSVKO4RK beIN SPORTS USA (@beINSPORTSUSA) February 6, 2017 It s pure inspiration from Pereira. He seems a little surprised by his teammate s abrupt toe poke towards him, and his first touch isn t great. That didn t matter though, and he immediately cleaned up his poor initial touch with a beautiful sweeping, sliced volley that flew past Las Palmas helpless goalkeeper into the top corner. This is exactly the type of strike that gets supporters excited, and there will be more than a few clamoring for Pereira to get his chance with the full Red Devils squad next year. Goals like that definitely aren t going to hurt his cause. MORE FROM FOX SOCCER
