For doctors, accurately diagnosing the source of your pain can be complicated. But it's essential in establishing the right course of treatment. At Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), diagnosing musculoskeletal injuries involves intricate detective work. That's where Dr. Hollis Potter, chair of the department of radiology at HSS comes in: "We're solving a problem, solving a puzzle," she says, "radiologists figure out and show the surgeon or your clinician exactly what's the problem. The reading of that MRI is going to guide exactly what happens to you in the operating room."
