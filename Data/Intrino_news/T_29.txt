Time Warner shareholders have voted to approve its acquisition with AT T, as well as the compensation proposal for Time Warner executives. CNBC's Julia Boorstin reports. Hew: Shep has some personal issues that cloud his vision pretty badly. A little surprised at Shep in this case because Trump has a favorable history with gays. FoxNews keeps Shep on staff simply because he is their primary conduit to the alternative lifestyle folks. Not saying he is a bad reporter, just that he is horribly biased. Take everything he says about President Trump for what it is. Just pure bs.
The American people voted and we have our president. We are highly pleased with our president as all Americans surely understand by now that he is a leader. We have been subject to 8 years of ineptitude by an incompetent community agitator. God bless President Trump. America loves you. 5.1k
