(Christian Slater reprises his role as a computer hacker for HP.HP) HP has launched a new ad campaign starring "Mr. Robot" actor Christian Slater to highlight the cybersecurity risks businesses face. In the HP web series, Slater reprises his hacker role as he infiltrates companies through the mail room printers all the way up to the computers in the boardroom. HP's global head of marketing Vikrant Batra told Marketing Week : "Historically B2B marketing doesn’t really grab your attention so we wanted to do something that really gets people to understand what is going on." In a press release , HP explained Slater's ability to play a hacker and his popularity in the cybersecurity world was central to his casting in the campaign. A report from research firm Cybersecurity Ventures estimates $1 trillion will be spent on cybersecurity by businesses between 2017 and 2021. In the UK, only 5% of FTSE 100 firms have a director responsible for cyber crime, according to a recent study from consulting company Deloitte .
