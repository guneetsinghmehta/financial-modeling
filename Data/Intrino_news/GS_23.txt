A total of 697 13-F filers held the stocks, with 194 creating new positions in the quarter and 288 adding to existing positions. A total of 192 funds closed out or reduced positions in the ETF.

Financial shares have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the “Trump trade” that followed the Nov. 8 presidential election. Banks are seen possibly having the most to gain from President Donald Trump’s pledge to roll back regulations. The administration has already taken steps to weaken the Dodd-Frank law put in place after the 2008-09 financial crisis.

Goldman shares were higher Wednesday, a day after notching its first record close since before the Great Recession.

The S P 500 SPX, -0.17% , which notched another record intraday high on Wednesday, is up 4.8% this calender year. Soros, a prominent Democratic donor and vehement Trump critic , stumbled in the aftermath of the election, according to the Wall Street Journal, which previously reported that the billionaire saw his personal positions lose around $1 billion before he moved to limit losses. At the same time, the broader fund, with around $30 billion under management, performed better. The Goldman stake, worth around $14.9 million as of Dec. 31, was a relatively small chunk of Soros’s portfolio, equal to 0.34% of his total reportable holdings. Liberty Broadband Corp. LBRDK, -0.63% remains his largest holding at more than 8.32 million shares worth $616.5 million as of Dec. 31.
