- By Holly LaFon During the Second Quarter, <strong>Dell</strong> announced a large bond issuance to finance the acquisition of <strong>EMC Corp.</strong> While the <strong>Dell</strong> issuance is not a situation that would traditionally be popular with event-driven or distressed credit mandates, we believed market dynamics led the deal to price ~200bps wider than where we valued the bonds. Following its own LBO in 2013, <strong>Dell</strong> significantly improved its business through a variety of operational improvements and cost cutting initiatives. We believed the company would follow a similar playbook with the <strong>EMC</strong> ( <strong>EMC</strong> ) acquisition and that the pro forma company would be a market leader in several areas including external storage, integrated infrastructure, and server virtualization software. <strong>Dell</strong> has stated a goal of achieving investment grade ratings within 18 - 24 months of the acquisition, setting a path to tightening in long duration bonds and to attractive returns for our portfolio.
