Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) push toward freedom from advertising dependency has been leading the company into massive financial losses. In 4Q16, the tech giant lost more than $1 billion in its experimental projects, including its autonomous driving unit, Waymo; its smart home division, Nest; its cable Internet business, Google Fiber; and its balloon Internet program, Project Loon. However, the good news is that its losses are narrowing. In 4Q16, the company had slightly more than $1 billion in operating losses in the Other Bets segment, which was lower than its $1.2 billion loss in 4Q15. Alphabet generated $262 million in revenues from its moonshot projects, which was over $150 million in the previous year. Alphabet ( GOOGL ) has recently made moves that could prune costs in its experimental arms. For example, separating its Autonomous Driving segment into a standalone entity called Waymo means that the business must now show value for the investment it has consumed since it was launched several years ago. Waymo executives have been put in the position where they must work harder to not only justify investment in the business, but also make the division self-sufficient. In other measures, Alphabet has either completely shut down certain moonshot programs or whittled down their workforces amid a push toward greater financial control. Looking at recent developments, Waymo is one of Alphabet’s moonshots that seems to be on the way to a brighter future. The California Department of Motor Vehicles recently released data showing that vehicles fitted with Waymo’s technology rank first with respect to accuracy and safety on the road. Waymo beat its competitors featuring vehicles powered by autonomous driving systems, including Ford (F), General Motors ( GM ), and Tesla ( TSLA ). Waymo’s automaker partners include Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ), and it’s reaching out to other partners. Quote data by Xignite
