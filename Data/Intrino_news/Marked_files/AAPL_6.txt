The major market averages were narrowly mixed early Friday but on track for big weekly gains. (AP) Stocks were mixed early Friday ahead of the Presidents Day holiday weekend, but the major market indexes remained on track for big weekly gains. The Dow Jones industrial average appeared set to halt its win streak at six sessions. The Dow fell 0.3%, the S P 500 dipped 0.2% and the Nasdaq was up less than 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was down 0.3%. Volume was mixed, tracking higher on the NYSE, but lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Thursday. Managed care, oil and building-related plays led the downside in today's stock market action, while networking and electronic consumer products issues outperformed. <strong>UnitedHealth Group</strong> ( <strong>UNH</strong> ), down more than 3%, was the biggest decliner on the Dow. Shares dropped back into a flat base with a 164.10 buy point. The Justice Department joined a whistleblower lawsuit alleging the managed care giant significantly overcharged Medicare. The lawsuit was unsealed Thursday. <strong>Apple</strong> ( <strong>AAPL</strong> ) edged slightly higher and was on track for a new closing high. Shares have risen nearly 3% this week, sending the stock to all-time highs. During the week, a regulatory filing showed billionaire investor Warren Buffett had quadrupled his stake in the iPhone maker to 57 million shares. Apple is well-extended past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point cleared in early January.<strong> Kraft Heinz</strong> ( <strong>KHC</strong> ) gapped up and rose 6% in massive trade and remains in buy range from a 90.64 flat-base entry. Shares slumped 4% Thursday to the 50-day line. The U.S. food products maker said it will keep pursuing <strong>Unilever</strong> ( <strong>UL</strong> ) even though the European company rejected the offer, calling it undervalued. <strong>Unilever</strong> gapped up and soared 10% to form the right side of its base. Snack foods maker <strong>Mondelez International</strong> ( <strong>MDLZ</strong> ) slumped more than 4% early before paring its loss. <strong>Arista Networks</strong> ( <strong>ANET</strong> ) gapped up and surged 15% in heavy volume after reporting better-than-expected Q4 results late Thursday. Several analysts raised their price targets on the cloud networking software provider. Shares vaulted past a 103.10 flat-base entry and are now extended from there but remain near the top of a buy range from the 111 open price of the gap up. On the IBD 50 , <strong>Cognex</strong> ( <strong>CGNX</strong> ) led with a 7% jump, followed by <strong>Mobileye</strong> ( <strong>MBLY</strong> ), which advanced 2%.
