If Apple ( AAPL ) hoped to boost its smartphone sales by raiding the Android market, the company may have to work harder. The latest data shows only a slight improvement in the Android-to-iPhone migration. According to CIRP (Consumer Intelligence Research Partners), only 15% of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales in the December quarter of 2016 came from customers who were previously Android users. In comparison, 14% of iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus sales were to previous Android owners the year prior. It seems the iPhone 7 series has done little to woo Android owners to the iOS platform. However, the iPhone 7 is widely popular among Apple’s existing customers. CIRP estimated that the iPhone 7 accounted for 72% of all US iPhone sales in the December quarter, which is Apple’s fiscal 1Q17. In comparison, only 68% of all iPhone sales in the same quarter of 2015 were of the iPhone 6S, the newest iPhone at the time. Cheaper Android devices are threatening iPhone’s market share in China and other emerging markets. Apple said its sales in China fell 12% in fiscal 1Q17 amid stiff competition from Android handsets and those running the YuOS platform by Alibaba ( BABA ). Apple needs to persuade more Android users to switch to iPhone to return to strong growth in the smartphone market. The company has recently struggled with weak iPhone sales, and investors are hoping that the launch of a radically redesigned iPhone 8  this year could change the story. Apple’s new iPhone not only needs to push existing Apple customers to upgrade their handsets, but also pull customers from Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) Google, Microsoft ( MSFT ), BlackBerry ( BBRY ), and other vendors.
