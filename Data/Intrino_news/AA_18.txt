Feb.08 -- David Fickling, a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist, explains why he thinks Rio Tinto should buy Alcoa. He speaks with Bloomberg's Haidi Lun and Betty Liu on Bloomberg Daybreak: Australia. Fickling's opinions are his own. Mike D: For anyone who doesn't watch Fox News with regularity. Shep Smith has always been anti-Trump. He takes President Trump's attacks on the media very personally. Myself, I find it a little over the top and he's definitely incapable of being anywhere near impartial when he reports on the President but that's not unusual these days. 5.2k
