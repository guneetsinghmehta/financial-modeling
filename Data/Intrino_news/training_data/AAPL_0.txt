This might sound a little odd, but my favorite gadget of this young year is a laptop power adapter. See, its no secret that Im rabid USB-C nut . Imagine: Youll soon have one power cord for every device (laptop, desktop, phone, tablet) from every manufacturer. A genuine universal power cord. Theres no upside-down way to insert a USB-C connector, and theres no wrong end on the cord. The wattage auto-adjusts to whatever youre charging. And the same cable carries not just power, but also video, audio, and data! Its just crazy brilliant. ( Heres my interview with the guy who spent three years with 600 electronics companies designing it.) USB-C is already on laptops from <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ), <strong>HP</strong> ( HPQ ), <strong>Razer</strong>, <strong>Google</strong> ( GOOG , GOOGL ), <strong>Microsoft</strong> ( MSFT ), <strong>Dell</strong>, <strong>Asus</strong>, <strong>Lenovo</strong> and others . And its already the charging jack on phones from <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Motorola</strong> ( MSI ), <strong>Samsung</strong>, <strong>LG</strong>, <strong>Huawei</strong>, <strong>OnePlus</strong>, <strong>LeEco</strong>, and many others . Rumor is that the iPhone 8 and Galaxy 8 phones will both use USB-C as well. As Ive written, the switch to USB-C currently involves adapters and replacement cables. But in the long term, it means well no longer have drawers like these: It also means that we can carry just one charger for all our stuff. Since Ive been learning to love the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, this is a big deal: Finding a smaller, nicer charger to replace the big white plastic 3-prong Apple one would make a huge difference to my bags travel weight. And so I found this: The Dart-C, billed as the worlds smallest laptop charger. And it really is tiny. Yet somehow, it provides 65 wattsplenty for laptops like the 12- and 13-inch MacBooks, the <strong>Lenovo</strong> ThinkPad 13, ASUS ZenBook 3, Dell XPS 13, and so on. Really honking laptops, like the 15-inch MacBook Pro, expect more wattage (85). This charger will work on those machinesjust not as fast. How do I love this thing? Let us count the ways. I keep one laptop charger my laptop bag, and one plugged in by the couch. So Ive been through the mill, trying to find just the right charging cord to be my spare. Since USB-C means that Im no longer locked into Apples proprietary chargers, Ive experimented with a Dell ($27, 30 watts) and a Udoli ($35, 45 watts), shown below. I knew both would take longer to charge than my MacBook Pros original charger (61 watts), but that didnt really matter for hotel-room purposes; theyd have overnight to charge. What I found, though, was that the <strong>Dell</strong> makes my laptop chime every few seconds, as though the cord is being unplugged and replugged. (Its probably not to spec, a buddy of mine guessesa hazard of the new, open USB-C world.) The Udoli works fine as long as the laptop is open but when closed, it occasionally does that same chime. (I asked Anthony Sagneri, chief technology officer of FINsix, the Darts maker, about this chiming business. His suspicion: The Intel chipsets inside most laptops can draw large peak currents for short periods. But if the charger isnt designed for those surges, they can trip its overcurrent mode, cutting power; at that point, the charger re-negotiates its connection. In other wordsding!) But the Dart? No problems. Its small, gorgeous, lightweight (3 ounces!), fast, and chime-free. There are some footnotes. First, the prongs dont fold up, as they do on some chargers. And the Dart-C is back-ordered; the company says it has begun shipping, but new orders wont ship until next month. (Its worth noting that the actual Dart-Cthe brick itselfis identical to the original Dart charger, as first seen on <strong>Kickstarter</strong>. All thats new is the USB-C cable that plugs into it, which contains all the USB-C electronics and smarts. In fact, if you bought the original Dartthe one that comes with plug tips for a wide range of laptop modelsyou can get just the USB-C cable for it for $35.) Second, this charger costs $100, which is even more than Apples chargers ($70 and $80). Thats a drag. Im confident that in the new, open world of USB-C chargers, well have more compact, attractive, well-engineered options. For now, th:ough, since this will be my one and only charger for all my gadgets, and since I travel a lot, and since space and weight are valued commodities in my laptop bag, Im going to bite the bullet. I have no problem saying it: The smallest laptop charger in the world is also one of the best. If youre a rabid USB-C nut like me, youll be in heaven.
