<p>If features that appeal to developers are what make <strong>Amazon</strong>&rsquo;s ( AMZN ) cloud, <strong>Amazon</strong> Web Services, popular, then <strong>Oracle</strong> ( ORCL ) is out to trim that advantage. The company recently&nbsp; acquired API (application program interface) specialist<strong> Apiary</strong> without disclosing how much it paid for the asset. However, the motive behind the move seems obvious. <strong>Apiary</strong> has the kind of technology and customer network that could lend more color to <strong>Oracle&rsquo;</strong>s cloud business. Along with <strong>IBM</strong> ( IBM ) and <strong>Alphabet</strong>&rsquo;s ( GOOGL ) <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Oracle</strong> belongs to the so-called cloud underdog group, where the dream is to be like <strong>Amazon</strong> ( AMZN ) or<strong> Microsoft</strong> ( MSFT ) someday. The chart above shows cloud infrastructure spending, which reached $38.1 billion in 2016 and is poised to grow to $55.8 billion in 2017, according to Canalys. With the technology that <strong>Apiary</strong> brings to the table,<strong> Oracle</strong> can simplify app development for its cloud customers, making its cloud more appealing. Additionally, <strong>Apiary</strong>&rsquo;s products are used by several Fortune 500 companies that <strong>Oracle</strong> could woo to its cloud. According to its website, <strong>Apiary</strong>&rsquo;s customers include <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Salesforce</strong> ( CRM ), <strong>GoPro</strong> ( GPRO ), and<strong> Viacom</strong> ( VIAB ). <strong>Oracle</strong>&rsquo;s move to acquire <strong>Apiary</strong> also seems to be an answer to <strong>Google</strong>&rsquo;s September 2016 acquisition of <strong>Apiary</strong> rival Apigee for $625 million. The acquisition of <strong>Apiary</strong> also comes shortly after <strong>Oracle</strong> announced plans to open three more cloud data center regions to strengthen its cloud position.</p>
