<strong>Alphabets</strong> ( GOOGL ) <strong>Google</strong> Fiber recently expanded into a new market: Raleigh, North Carolina. Although subtle, the move suggests that Alphabet is in the Internet service business to stay despite recent speculation that the company could be planning to exit the high-speed Internet market. The speculations were sparked by <strong>Alphabets</strong> move to pare down its <strong>Google</strong> Fiber workforce . <strong>Google</strong> Fiber is part of <strong>Alphabets</strong> operations geared toward expanding the companys nonadvertising income. <strong>Alphabet</strong> has been aggressively seeking growth outside its core advertising business at a time when its facing increasingly tough competition from <strong>Facebook</strong> ( FB ), <strong>Twitter</strong> ( TWTR ), Snap, and others for online advertising budgets. Advertising accounted for 85.9% of <strong>Alphabets</strong> ( GOOGL ) revenues in 4Q16, down from 89.4% in 4Q15, as the chart above shows. The decline of advertising income as a proportion of total sales suggests that <strong>Alphabets</strong> nonadvertising business push is beginning to bear fruit. Alphabets nonadvertising businesses include <strong>Google</strong> Play, Hardware, and Cloud Computing. The segments sales rose 62% to $3.4 billion in 4Q16. Alphabet reports all operations outside its core <strong>Google</strong> Search business under its Other Bets segment, whose sales rose 75% to $262 million in 4Q16. <strong>Google</strong> Fiber is reported under Other Bets alongside its driverless technology unit, Waymo; its smart home unit, Nest; and other experimental projects.
