Stocks in the U.S. closed at new all-time highs for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday as President Donald Trump's talk on taxes continued to cheer on investors anticipating his pro-growth policies. Health care and consumer staples led gains on the S P 500, rising 1.1% and 0.8% respectively, while 24 of the 30 blue chips on the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced, led by a 3.7% jump in <strong>Procter Gamble</strong> ( PG ) and a 2.3% rise in <strong>Pfizer</strong> ( PFE ). Ahead of a meeting with retail industry executives, Trump said he would unveil a "massive tax plan" in the "not too distant future" that would lower taxes for both individuals and businesses. Data released earlier in the day also showed US economic strength, with retail sales and consumer price inflation both coming in ahead of expectations. The economic data eclipsed the second part of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony to Congress. Speaking to the House Financial Services Committee, Yellen echoed her remarks to the Senate on Tuesday that the economy is on track for additional, albeit gradual, rate hikes in 2017. A slight pullback in US oil futures weighed on energy shares, which fell 0.4% on the S P 500. Utilities were down 0.6% in the steepest decline.
