Activism - Hedge Fund Analysis - Hedge Funds - News Billionaire Trump Supporter Carl Icahn Made These Changes To His Portfolio Amid Trump s Win Published on February 16, 2017 at 2:05 pm by Raymond Jones in Activism , Hedge Fund Analysis , Hedge Funds , News Page 1 of 3 Next // FINANCE ARTICLE AD IMONKEY_ADS.push({ targetContainerId: "top-left-ad-article-atf-banner-ad", provider: "IC", // IC type: "banner-atf", currentPage: "blog", isFinance: true, isListPost: false, isMobile: false }); Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn has been constantly in the news since Donald Trump launched his Presidential campaign. During the campaign, the man who would become POTUS announced that Mr. Icahn who has been an active supporter of his candidacy from day one would be among his foremost choices for Treasury Secretary. While Mr. Icahn politely declined that offer, he recently was roped in by the Trump administration as a special adviser on regulatory reform. This decision hasn t gone well with some of the Senate Democrats including Elizabeth Warren, who are opposing his appointment citing a conflict of interest . While it won t be wrong to say that Mr. Icahn, for his part, has benefited immensely from Mr. Trump s win both materially and socially it would perhaps be wrong and too early to assume that he would use his new role to benefit financially, considering that he is an octogenarian, multi-billionaire who has been advocating for corporate reforms for years now.

The recent 13F filing of Mr. Icahn s hedge fund Icahn Capital LP , one of the 140 Biggest and Most Famous Activist Hedge Funds , suggests that this was likely true. According to the filing, Icahn Capital LP s 13F portfolio was worth $22.37 billion at the end of 2016, almost 13% more than the $19.80 billion it was worth at the end of September. The filing also revealed that during the fourth quarter the fund made additional purchases in three stocks, reduced its holding in three stocks and sold its entire stake in one stock. Moreover, at the end of the fourth quarter, Icahn Capital LP s top-10 equity holdings accounted for over 90% of its portfolio s value.
