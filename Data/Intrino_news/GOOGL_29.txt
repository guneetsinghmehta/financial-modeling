Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) Google Fiber recently expanded into a new market: Raleigh, North Carolina. Although subtle, the move suggests that Alphabet is in the Internet service business to stay despite recent speculation that the company could be planning to exit the high-speed Internet market. The speculations were sparked by Alphabet’s move to pare down its Google Fiber workforce . Google Fiber is part of Alphabet’s operations geared toward expanding the company’s nonadvertising income. Alphabet has been aggressively seeking growth outside its core advertising business at a time when it’s facing increasingly tough competition from Facebook ( FB ), Twitter ( TWTR ), Snap, and others for online advertising budgets. Advertising accounted for 85.9% of Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) revenues in 4Q16, down from 89.4% in 4Q15, as the chart above shows. The decline of advertising income as a proportion of total sales suggests that Alphabet’s nonadvertising business push is beginning to bear fruit. Alphabet’s nonadvertising businesses include Google Play, Hardware, and Cloud Computing. The segment’s sales rose 62% to $3.4 billion in 4Q16. Alphabet reports all operations outside its core Google Search business under its Other Bets segment, whose sales rose 75% to $262 million in 4Q16. Google Fiber is reported under Other Bets alongside its driverless technology unit, Waymo; its smart home unit, Nest; and other experimental projects. Not only did Other Bets’s sales increase in 4Q16, but losses in the segment also fell 10% compared to 4Q15. Google Fiber competes with incumbents such as Comcast ( CMCSA ), Verizon ( VZ ), and AT T (T).
