Analysts expect Home Depot ( HD ) to post gross margins, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) margins, and net margins of 34.1%, 15.1%, and 7.4%, respectively. In 4Q15, the company’s margins were 34.1%, 14.5%, and 7.0%, respectively. Although Home Depot’s gross margin is expected to remain constant, analysts expect EBITDA margins and net margins to improve due to the expansion of the supply chain and increased productivity. The implementation of Project Sync, its Supply Chain Synchronization project, is expected to improve the company’s in-stock, inventory productivity, and logistics costs. The initiative is expected to improve inventory shrinkage, thus raising gross margins. However, the expansion in gross margin is expected to be offset by the acquisition of Interline. Analysts are expecting Home Depot’s SG A (selling, general, and administrative) expenses to fall from 19.9% in 4Q15 to 18.6% in 4Q16. They expect it to boost the company’s 4Q16 EBITDA margins and net margins. However, rises in D A (depreciation and amortization) expenses from 2.0% to 2.1% and tax rates from 36.4% to 37.0% are expected to offset some of the gains in net margins. Investments in technological advancements are expected to raise D A expenses. In 4Q16, analysts expect Lowe’s ( LOW ), Bed Bath Beyond ( BBBY ), and Williams-Sonoma ( WSM ) to post EBITDA margins of 10.8%, 14.5%, and 16.3%, respectively. For the next four quarters, analysts are expecting Home Depot to post EBITDA and net margins of 16.5% and 8.5%, respectively. In the corresponding quarters of the previous year, the company posted EBITDA and net margins of 16.0% and 8.2%, respectively. Next, let’s take a look at Home Depot’s 4Q16 EPS (earnings per share).
