Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. ( HPE ) announced Monday the unveiling of its new 3PAR storage innovations, including a next-generation HPE 3PAR Operating System that “provides a futureproof foundation for hybrid IT,” according to the company.

The Palo, Alto, Calif.-based tech giant explains that as all-flash data storage becomes the new normal, its clients are realizing that pure-play all-flash systems cannot address the new requirements imposed by a “third wave” of flash evolution. HPE says that all-flash storage vendors must now offer solutions that not only provide competitive performance for individual flash arrays, but also help customers simplify operations across a complex data-center ecosystem, mitigate risks from edge to core to cloud and support hybrid IT transformation. The firm says its HPE 3PAR innovations meet these new demands by offering support for cloud-native applications, data-center-wide orchestration, tier-1 resiliency and a seamless path to emerging technologies such as storage class memory. "Customers see all-flash storage as only one part of a hybrid IT strategy," said Bill Philbin, senior vice president of HPE’s Data Center Infrastructure Group. "3PAR is a best-in-class array but we go further to optimize the full stack and provide data mobility across systems—an approach that has helped us grow faster than the market over the last 18 months." HPE’s latest product announcement follows the firm’s larger initiative to secure its place at the head of a hybrid IT revolution, as it transitions from a period in which it trimmed down its core businesses to focus on hardware sales and emerging market investments.
