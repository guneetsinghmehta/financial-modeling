There are several metrics that can be used to value a company. However, for commodity companies, the EV-to-EBITDA 1 multiple is the preferred valuation metric. A forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple tells us how a company is valued for each dollar of its EBITDA. In this article, we’ll look at Alcoa’s ( AA ) valuation multiples. Currently, Alcoa ( AA ) is trading at 5.8x its forward EBITDA. We don’t have comparable historical data since Alcoa was split in late 2016. BHP Billiton ( BHP ) and Rio Tinto ( RIO ) are currently trading at forward EV-to-EBITDA ratios of 6.5x and 7.6x, respectively. Century Aluminum ( CENX ) is trading at a generous forward multiple of 52x. The entire mining space has seen a rerating following Donald Trump’s election as the 45th US president. As a result, mining companies’ valuation multiples have seen some expansion. Integrated operations make Alcoa one of the few listed pure-play aluminum producers. Rio Tinto is another major aluminum producer, but the company is mainly an iron ore play. Century Aluminum doesn’t have an upstream business. Norsk Hydro ( NHYDY ) is one of the few publicly traded integrated aluminum producers. In our view, Alcoa’s valuation multiples could be somewhat conservative, looking at the company’s prospects and relatively higher multiples of some of the other mining companies. Meanwhile, Alcoa’s valuation multiples and price action would largely depend on movement in aluminum prices.
