While Apple (AAPL) has soared almost 17% this year to a record high, its chip foundry supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. , or TSMC (2330.Taiwan/ TSM ), gained only 4%, despite being the sole foundry supplier for the much-anticipated iPhone 8 (or iPhone X according to some people).  Meanwhile, other Apple suppliers have blossomed. For instance, Largan Precision (3008.Taiwan), which makes dual cameras for Apple, has already advanced 25%. TSMC has outperformed its large-cap peers in Asia for six consecutive years, but this year it may well underperform, according to Goldman Sachs , which downgraded the chip maker s stock to Neutral. The reasoning is simple: smartphone chip foundry and Apple s iPhone in particular has become so dominant in TSMC s business profile that it is hard for TSMC for seek growth in other hot areas. Put another way, smart cars and virtual reality headsets are simply not big enough to counter the slowdown in smartphone growth. The chart below shows it all. While smartphone was a $415 billion business in 2016, virtual reality was only $15 billion. But don t short TSMC. It still offers a decent 3.2% dividend yield.
