Nokia ( NOK ) seems to have returned to the handset business with a splash. The company’s first handset after a nearly two-year lull, the Nokia 6, sold out within a minute during its first flash sale in China. The handset was exclusively offered in China. The company didn’t say how many units were sold in the first flash sale, but it plans to hold more such sales. China has demonstrated great interest in the Nokia 6 at a time when consumer interest in Apple ( AAPL ) iPhones seems to be waning. Apple said its sales in Greater China decreased 12% year-over-year to $16.2 billion in fiscal 1Q17. The company’s worldwide sales totaled $78.4 billion. Apple is betting on a revolutionary iPhone model this year to jumpstart sales. If Nokia’s smartphone brands prove widely popular among Chinese consumers, its return to growth may be delayed or the company may not recover its footing in the market. The Nokia 6 handset, which features 4GB RAM and a 5.5-inch display, costs ~$245, compared to Apple’s iPhone, which costs more than $600. Competitive pricing has already given Chinese brands Huawei and Xiaomi an edge against Apple and Samsung ( SSNLF ) in China and several other emerging markets. Nokia is planning to release more smartphone models this year, including the Nokia P1, which it plans to unveil at the MWC 2017 event. Nokia P1 is expected to be a premium handset costing $800 for a model that offers 128 GB in storage and ~$950 for the 256 GB version. Nokia’s return to the phone business comes two years after it exited the scene following the sale of its Devices unit to Microsoft ( MSFT ). However, the return of Nokia is not likely to rattle Apple or also other smartphone vendors such as Microsoft, Alphabet ( GOOGL ), and BlackBerry ( BBRY ). Quote data by Xignite
