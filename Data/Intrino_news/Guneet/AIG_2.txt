<p>There s nothing quite like a $3 billion quarterly loss to make investors nervous. <strong>American International Group</strong> &nbsp;( AIG ) investors were treated to that sized loss for the fourth quarter and shares tumbled 9% on Wednesday, making it the biggest loser in the S P 500 . Bondholders remain nervous too. It didn t help the picture that AIG continues with aggressive buybacks and dividends, despite the losses. It decided to add a $3.5 billion to its buyback program Wednesday. Kathleen Shanley, senior investment grade analyst at corporate bond research firm <strong>Gimme Credit</strong>,&nbsp; writes: AIG is currently on watch for possible downgrade at the insurance rating agency A.M. Best, so it is possible that it will temper its buyback appetite to ward off a cut to its ratings. But given the ongoing pressure from activist investors, we continue to see risk for the bonds to underperform. AIG has a big reserve shortfall across many lines at the same time that claims are higher than anticipated. Cash comes from selling off divisions. The stock was up more than 2% Thursday to $62.25.
