Previously, we looked at Alcoa’s ( AA ) earnings and shipment guidance. The market is currently interested in cash flows. Generating negative free cash flow leads to cash burn and as a result, companies may have to borrow to fund their deficits. Commodity producers ( NHYDY ) ( XME ) such as Century Aluminum ( CENX ) and Rio Tinto ( RIO ) are already grappling with huge debt levels, and negative free cash flows would only worsen the situation. In this article, we’ll look at Alcoa’s 4Q16 cash flows and see whether they are sustainable. Alcoa ( AA ) generated $200 million in cash in November and December 2016. However, it is also pertinent to consider the impact of working capital on Alcoa’s 4Q16 cash flows. Alcoa managed to reduce its days working capital to 13 in the quarter. Although the metric sounds remarkable after looking at industry standards, it still should be taken with a grain of salt. Alcoa typically sees a seasonal reduction in working capital in the fourth quarter while the company adds working capital in the first quarter. Looking at yearly performance, Alcoa generated free cash flows of -$715 million in fiscal 2016. We don’t have comparable free cash flows for previous periods due to Alcoa’s split. Alcoa may not be able to replicate its 4Q16 cash flows in fiscal 2017. The company plans to increase its capital investment this year. Given the improved market scenario, Alcoa may have to add to its working capital. Nonetheless, the company could still post positive free cash flows in 2017 if commodity prices hold their recent gains. In the next article, we’ll look at Alcoa’s leverage metrics.
