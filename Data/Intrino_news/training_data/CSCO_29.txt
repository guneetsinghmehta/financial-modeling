<strong>Cisco</strong> (NASDAQ: CSCO ) reported its fiscal 2017 second-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday, and the market's reaction says it all: Initially, shares fell in after-hours trading. But after investors had time for a more detailed review, <strong>Cisco</strong> shares were up about 2.5% by midday Thursday. Revenue in Q2 declined 2% year-over-year to $11.58 billion and earnings per share (EPS) including one-time expenses nosedived 24% to $0.47, though after factoring in one-time costs, <strong>Cisco</strong>'s $0.57 a share matched the EPS from Q2 fiscal 2016. The upside to these somewhat disappointing, though not unexpected, quarterly results, is that <strong>Cisco</strong> narrowly beat consensus estimates. The Street had forecast EPS excluding items of $0.56 and revenue of $11.56 billion, both a whisker below the actual results. The mid-range of guidance for 0% to negative 2% revenue growth this quarter was, again, slightly better than the 1.2% decline expected. Also an upside, the report indicates that <strong>Cisco</strong>'s efforts to increase sustainable, recurring revenue are taking hold. Cisco mitigated the impact of a 5.5% year-over-year revenue decline in its product segment thanks to a 5% bump in service sales to $3.1 billion. <strong>Cisco</strong> also attributed its 9% jump in deferred revenue to $17.1 billion to its subscription-based and software offerings. In addition to boosting its quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.29, <strong>Cisco</strong> reported strong data security growth of 14% to $528 million. And the segment is up 13% to $1.07 billion this fiscal year. Given its mixed results, it's no wonder investors were on the proverbial fence. 10 stocks we like better than <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
