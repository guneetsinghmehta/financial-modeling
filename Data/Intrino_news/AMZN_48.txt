Shares of Amazon.com  ( AMZN ) are up $4.38, or half a percent, at $840.77, after Oppenheimer Co .’s Jason Helfstein today reiterated an Outperform rating, and an $970 price target, after reviewing the company’s 10-K filing with the Securities Exchange Commission, and coming away impressed with “just how efficient” is its cloud computing business, AWS. Drawing on the work of his colleague Tim Horan , who follows cloud computing closely, Helfstein sees Amazon cutting prices but also lowering capital spending this year, leading to higher cash flow: We tweak our 2018E growth rate down by 1% as we raise our price cut expectations/lower our CAPX in 2017 by $1B to $6B. This translates into $0.82 of incremental revenue/$1 of CAPX, down slightly from 2016. Longer-term we model a return to ~$0.70/$1 of CAPX and now look for $11.1B in unlevered FCF in 2020, up from $10.5B. Bottom Line: We do expect AWS CAPX will ramp into 2018, but value-added services/hardware efficiencies continue to drive high returns. Competition and lower prices will likely drive marginal returns slightly lower, but we remain confident in the FCF generation characteristics of the business and now value the segment at $258B vs. a previous valuation of $212B. Helfstein cuts his 2018 revenue estimate to $206.9 billion from $207 billion, and cuts his Ebtida estimate to $26.48 billion from $27.3 billion. Helfstein notes that More efficient return on capital is a positive for Microsoft ( MSFT ) as its cloud business continues to scale. Error message Be the first to leave a comment on this blog.
