So far in this series, we’ve looked at Home Depot’s ( HD ) estimated revenue, sources of revenue, and estimated EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margins. In this part, we’ll take a look at analysts’ EPS (earnings per share) estimates. Home Depot’s management expects the company to post EPS of $6.33 in 2016. With EPS of $5.01 in the first three quarters of 2016, the company is expected to post EPS of $1.32 in 4Q16. Analysts are expecting Home Depot’s EPS to be $1.33, which represents a rise of 13.4% from $1.17 in 4Q15. The rise in EPS is expected to be driven by revenue growth, expansion of margins, and share repurchases in the last 12 months. In the first three quarters of 2016, the company has purchased shares worth $4.6 billion. In 4Q16, management expects to repurchase shares worth $2.4 billion. Share repurchases will lower the number of shares outstanding, thus boosting the company’s EPS. The company has outperformed analysts’ estimates in the past five quarters. When that happens, the stock tends to rise. In 4Q16, Home Depot’s peers Lowe’s ( LOW ), Bed Bath Beyond ( BBBY ), and Williams-Sonoma ( WSM ) are expected to post EPS growth of 33.0%, 13.6%, and -2.2%, respectively. For the next four quarters, analysts are expecting Home Depot to post EPS of $6.85. That would be a rise of 12.4% from $6.18 in the corresponding quarters of the previous year. The rise in EPS is expected to be driven by revenue growth, expansion of EBITDA margins, and share repurchases. Next, we’ll look at Home Depot’s dividend policy. Quote data by Xignite
