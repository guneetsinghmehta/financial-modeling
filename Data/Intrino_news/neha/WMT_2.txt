It sold the majority of its holdings in the world's largest retailer last year. In the final three months of 2016 alone, according to <strong>Berkshire</strong>&rsquo;s latest 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Buffett trimmed his <strong>Walmart</strong> holdings to 1.4 million shares from 13 million at the end of September. With an ownership stake of just 0.05%, <strong>Berkshire</strong> is no longer a major shareholder in <strong>Walmart</strong>.

But for buy-and-hold investors, <strong>Berkshire</strong>&rsquo;s disaffection with the blue-chip company can be instructive nonetheless. Here are three reasons we think Warren Buffett is dumping <strong>Walmart</strong> stock. (Prices as of February 16.) The main reason Buffett is abandoning <strong>Walmart</strong> is that it&rsquo;s losing out to <strong>Amazon.com</strong>, says David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business who studies Buffett and is a <strong>Berkshire</strong> shareholder. Buffett has made no secret of his admiration for <strong>Amazon</strong>'s CEO, Jeff Bezos. "We haven't seen many businessmen like him,&rdquo; Buffett says of Bezos. &ldquo;Overwhelmingly, he's taken things you and I've been buying, and he's figured out a way to make us happier buying those products, either by fast delivery or prices or whatever it may be, and that's remarkable." E-commerce sales are growing faster than sales at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and should continue to do so. In January, non-store retailers enjoyed year-over-year sales gains of 14.5%, according to the Census Bureau. Furniture stores, electronics stores, sporting goods stores and department stores all suffered declines. <strong>Walmart</strong> is investing in e-commerce in order to ride the wave, including its high-profile purchase of Jet.com, but <strong>Amazon</strong> remains the market leader. Buffett tends to prefer companies that are at the forefront of their industries. <strong>Berkshire</strong>, which first ventured into <strong>Walmart</strong> stock in 2005, had amassed more than 60 million shares by the end of 2015. That amounted to a sizable 2% ownership stake. But the investment has proved to be largely disappointing. <strong>Walmart</strong> shares have gained 32% on a price basis since mid 2005, while Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500-stock index is up 80% over the same time frame. Analysts at Stifel have a &ldquo;hold&rdquo; recommendation on <strong>Walmart</strong> shares today. At best, Stifel analysts forecast &ldquo;modest share gains&rdquo; assuming <strong>Walmart</strong> can improve online and mobile ordering and increase organic grocery offerings. 1100 13th Street, NW, Suite 750 Washington, DC 20005 202.887.6400 Toll-free: 800.544.0155 All Contents 2017, The Kiplinger Washington Editors</p>
