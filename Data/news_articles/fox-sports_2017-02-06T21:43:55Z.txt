Smith and his wife Jewel revealed in January that the baby girl they were expecting to be born near the end of the NBA season had arrived five months prematurely and weighed just a single pound. My loves #KotaBear #SlimDem A photo posted by JR Smith (@teamswish) on Jan 12, 2017 at 2:51pm PST We know a lot of you congratulated us on the expectancy of our little baby girl, but we had her five months early … she’s five days old today, and her name is Dakota, and she weighs 1 pound. We know we’re not the only family that has been through this or who will go through this, and that is why we decided to share what we’re going through. Please keep us in your prayers. More than a month after Dakota was born, Smith was finally able to hold his baby. Today is one of the greatest days of my life. Today I get to hold my youngest for the first time! GOD is GREAT! #DakotaStrong A photo posted by JR Smith (@teamswish) on Feb 6, 2017 at 9:10am PST (function(d, s, id) {
