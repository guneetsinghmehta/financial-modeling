<strong>Waymo</strong>, another <strong>Alphabet</strong> ( GOOGL ) project for a future that is not dependent on advertising spending, boasts the top-rated autonomous driving technology , according to data recently released by Californias Department of Motor Vehicles (or DMV). The California DMVs report shows that <strong>Waymo</strong> vehicles covered 30 times more miles than the rest of the competitors combined during 2016 road tests in California. Additionally, the data show <strong>Waymo</strong> technology to be the most accurate in navigating California roads. According to the California DMV and as the chart above shows, Waymo vehicles only required human intervention for safety 0.2 times per 1,000 miles traveled. <strong>Fords</strong> (F) autonomous vehicles required safety intervention 5.1 times, <strong>General Motorss</strong> ( GM ) vehicles required intervention 18.5 times, and <strong>Teslas</strong> ( TSLA ) cars required intervention 330 times per 1,000 miles traveled. If <strong>Alphabet</strong> aimed to promote <strong>Waymo</strong> as the best option for automakers seeking to produce driverless cars, then the California data could give it a boost on that front. While Uber, Ford, <strong>General Motors</strong>, <strong>Tesla</strong>, <strong>Toyota</strong> ( TM ), and others are developing their own self-driving systems in house, they could find themselves adopting <strong>Waymos</strong> technology if they cant match its accuracy and safety. This move could help these companies meet state requirements. Although Alphabet doesnt break out <strong>Waymo</strong> sales, it combines them with other experimental divisions and reports them as Other Bets revenues. For 4Q16, <strong>Alphabets</strong> Other Bets revenues totaled $262 million, significantly up from $150 million in 4Q15. In addition to <strong>Waymo</strong>, the Other Bets unit comprises <strong>Alphabets</strong> high-speed Internet business, <strong>Google</strong> Fiber; its delivery service, <strong>Google</strong> Express; and its home automation division, Nest.
