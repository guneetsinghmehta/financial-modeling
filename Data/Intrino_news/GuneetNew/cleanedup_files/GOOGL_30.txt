While <strong>Alphabet</strong> ( GOOGL ) may seem to be on a diet given its recent moves such as shutting down its <strong>Titan</strong> drone Internet program and whittling down its workforce at <strong>Google</strong> Fiber, the tech giant continues to show an appetite for bolt-on acquisitions. In a recent development, <strong>Google</strong>, the most profitable <strong>Alphabet</strong> branch, said it was acquiring a little-known unit of <strong>Twitter</strong> ( TWTR ) called Fabric. While Fabric may not ring many bells, it is a tool for developing mobile apps and has been around since 2014. Fabric is used by more than 580,000 developers, according to the Wall Street Journal . Smartphone app usage is on the rise, and this trend is helping drive services revenue for companies such as <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ). Mobile app researcher App Annie released findings that showed that app downloads increased 15% in 2016, with developers receiving $89 billion in app revenues. This figure is set to rise to $189 billion by 2020. App distribution platform operators keep 30% of app revenues while developers take 70%. <strong>Twitters</strong> Fabric previously competed with <strong>Googles</strong> Firebase. Following the acquisition, Fabric and Firebase teams would work together. For <strong>Google</strong>, the acquisition now puts two of the most widely used mobile app tools under the companys control. Because Fabric is popular among developers for <strong>Apples</strong> iOS platform, <strong>Google</strong> can now encourage those developers to create Android versions of their iOS apps, making the Android ecosystem richer in content and apps. Additionally, Fabric could help increase sales at <strong>Googles</strong> Cloud division. Firebase users buy cloud storage and other cloud services from <strong>Google</strong>. The more than 580,000 developers coming through Fabric increase the pool of developers that Google can target with its cloud products. Google is locked in fierce competition with <strong>Amazon</strong> ( AMZN ), <strong>Microsoft</strong> ( MSFT ), <strong>Oracle</strong> ( ORCL ), and <strong>IBM</strong> ( IBM ) for control of the cloud computing market.
