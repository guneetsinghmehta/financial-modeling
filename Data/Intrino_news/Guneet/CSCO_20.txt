<p>Published: Feb 16, 2017 4:36 p.m. ET Chevron, <strong>Exxon Mobil</strong> among largest decliners as Dow closes higher By U.S. stock indexes snapped a multi-session streak of simultaneous records Thursday, weighed down by a decline in energy stocks, with the Dow industrials the only index to gain another record high at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.29% &nbsp;finished up 7.91 points, or less than 0.1%, at a record 20,619.77, with gains from components like <strong>Cisco Systems Inc</strong> . CSCO, +0.35% and <strong>Coca-Cola Co</strong>. KO, +0.00% &nbsp;tempered by losses from <strong>ExxonMobil Corp</strong>. XOM, -0.86% &nbsp; and <strong>Chevron Corp</strong>. CVX, -0.95% &nbsp;even as oil prices rose. The six-day streak of record closes for the blue-chip average is its longest since Dec. 13, 2016. The S P 500 index SPX, -0.17% finished down 2.03 points, or 0.1%, at 2,347.22, retreating from an intraday high set shortly after the market opened at 2,351.32. Energy and consumer-discretionary shares led decliners, while telecom and utilities shares attracted buyers. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.06% &nbsp;closed down 4.54 points, or 0.1%, at 5,814.90, snapping a streak of seven straight closing records. On Wednesday all three benchmarks closed at record highs for a fifth session in a row , something they hadn&rsquo;t done since January 1992 . Stocks, which had earlier in the session switched between small gains and losses, started settling in negative territory during President Donald Trump&rsquo;s news conference as he announced that a proposed replacement to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, would come in March, before any proposals on tax reform . The three benchmarks are up about 3% to 4% since the start of the month, helped by Trump&rsquo;s promises of a &ldquo;massive&rdquo; tax plan . Also in focus were upbeat remarks on the U.S. economy from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who has also signaled a March interest-rate hike is possible, while noting that the economy is on a solid footing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a big run in the near term, so some weakness is normal especially if you want the bull run to continue,&rdquo; said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, said in an interview. &ldquo;You see these records and you almost don&rsquo;t want to see them, you want more slow and steady.&rdquo; On the other hand, Detrick noted that the S P 500 has gone 43 sessions without an intraday move of 1% or more, suggesting the market appears afraid to make a big leap, and increasing the chances that the extended period of low volatility we have enjoyed for a year cannot last too much longer. Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet, LLC, in research notes to clients indicated that a correction could be around the corner, citing high levels of optimism, which can be a contra-indicator. &ldquo;But it also may mean that the market&rsquo;s long-term uptrend simply has reignited after a few years of violent back and forth price action,&rdquo; Cappelleri said. Other analysts warned that markets aren't taking the risk of higher rates seriously enough. &ldquo;This rally may come to a quick end if expectations for a March rate hike begin increasing,&rdquo; warned <strong>ADS Securities</strong> researcher Konstantinos Anthis in a note Thursday. The market sees a 22% chance of a rate rise in March, down from 31% on Wednesday, according to the CME Group&rsquo;s FedWatch tool .

Oil futures CLH7, -0.52% &nbsp;rose 0.5% to settle at $53.36 a barrel and gold futures GCH7, -0.20% &nbsp;settled up 0.7% at $1,241.60 an ounce, as the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.36% pulled back . Richard Thaler, an expert in behavioral economics, talked to MarketWatch about his &rdquo;lazy&rdquo; investing strategy that allows investors to maximize their returns while doing very little.

CBS, -0.32% &nbsp;and packed-foods juggernaut <strong>Kraft Heinz Co.</strong> KHC, +7.57% also posted results late Wednesday, serving up earnings that topped forecasts, but investors weren't convinced. CBS shares finished up 0.3%, while <strong>Kraft</strong> shares dropped 4.2%.

Economic news: Strong economic data on Thursday followed a trio of better-than-expected releases on Wednesday. Weekly jobless claims rose by 5,000 to 239,000, but they remained at exceedingly low levels that reflect the resilience of a nearly eight-year-old economic recovery. In the housing market, construction on new houses fell 2.6% in January, but another increase in permits points to builders breaking ground on more units in the months ahead. The Philadelphia Fed said its manufacturing index soared in February to a reading of 43.3 from 23.6 in January. That is the highest level since early 1984. &mdash;Victor Reklaitis in London contributed to this article. Join the conversation Copyright 2017 <strong>MarketWatch, Inc.</strong> All rights reserved.
