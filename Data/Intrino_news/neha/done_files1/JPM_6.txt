<strong>JPMorgan</strong> and <strong>Citigroup</strong> are apparently among the top 10 global financial stocks that score high on gender diversity relative to sector peers. That explains why the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity ETF ( SHE ) has nearly 17% of the fund s assets in the financial sector. The global financial sector overall scored well on gender diversity, with a 50/50 split between men and women employees, according to <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> s latest report in its sustainability research series . Compared to the materials and utilities sector, which have women occupying about 20%-25% positions, that s progressive. However, when comparing higher ranks, empowerment, equality in pay, financials don t look that good. While women are well-represented overall, many don t end up in the higher ranks. There are more women executives in telecom, real estate, and in utilities. Also, the average executive pay gap between men and women in the sectoris wider than most. <strong>JPMorgan</strong> ( JPM ) leads in North America with Marianne Lake as CFO and 4 out of ten operating committee members being female. The average bank in the region has women in 22% of its executive positions. <strong>JPMorgan</strong> also reported two years ago that 49% of its new hires globally were women. Here s more from the report: On pay equality, our quantitative analysis of total compensation of executives and board directors resulted in near exact parity between men and women at JPM. Note that the Department of Labor recently filed suit against JPM for alleged discriminatory pay practices against female employees, seeking back pay and salary adjustments for at least 93 employees ( DoL press release, 18 Jan 2017 ). We do not have pay data below the executive level. At the board level, JPM has only 2 women out of 12 board directors (17%), lagging the average of 24% among peers. There are also no women as chairs of key committees. Only 1 of 6 unique key committee members (17%) is a woman, who sits only on the Audit committee, compared to a peer average around 30%. As exchange-traded funds and other investing vehicles have ballooned in number, the task of figuring out what works well and what doesn t has only gotten harder. <strong>Barrons</strong>.com s Focus on Funds looks under the hood of ETFs, mutual funds and hedge funds for overlooked values, actionable ideas and the latest pitfalls for fund investors.
