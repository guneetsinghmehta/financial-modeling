In fact, the Viking Long fund failed to beat the MSCI World Index for the first time since the fund s inception, gaining 3.9% in 2016 compared to that index s 5.1% gains. The recent investor letter stated that the fund s concentrated sector bets did not fare well and that it was very disappointed by these results . It has since restructured its stock picking team and plans to invest more money in financial and consumer stocks. Those two sectors accounted for just 5% of the value of the fund s 13F portfolio on September 30, with that figure rising to over 10% by the end of 2016.
