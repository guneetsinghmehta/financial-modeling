<strong>Coca-Cola Co</strong>. ( KO ) announced it has raised its quarterly dividend by 5.7% to $0.37 a share on February 16. (See also, Coke Using Data to Generate Product Ideas ) The increase means that its annualized dividend is now $1.48 a share, compared to $1.40 per share in 2016. Shareholders of record as of March 15, 2017 will receive their first quarterly dividend payment on April 3, 2017. The beverage giant said the increase reflects its confidence in its long-term cash flow , pointing out that it paid over $6 billion in dividends in 2016. <strong>Coke</strong> generated $8.796 billion in cash flow from operations in 2016, while its free cash flow was $6.534 billion. By translation, it paid roughly 68.7% of its cash flow from operations in dividends in 2016. In addition, it paid 92.5% of its free cash flow as dividends in 2016. With its 2016 EPS clocking in at $1.49, its 2016 (earnings) payout ratio was about 93.96%. Over the last five years, its earnings payout ratio has increased by 150%, while dividend per share has only risen by 37.25%. The smaller increase is a reflection of the decrease in revenue, which is a result of the structural changes that KO is undertaking. Also, global macroeconomic headwinds , as well as the decline in the soda market, have been affecting results. Its total long-term debt has increased by 40.17% to about $45.71 billion in the last five years. With the payout ratios already high, its likely that <strong>Coke</strong> has been taking on more debt to make sure it can keep its shareholders happy. Thats not a prerequisite for a safe dividend. No, KO is not likely to stop paying dividends now, having increased dividends each year in the last 54 years. And some analysts  <strong>Wells Fargo</strong>s Bonnie Herzog, for instance  are touting the notion of re-accelerated earnings after its transition period in 2018. So its payout ratios might look more comfortable then. Still, itll always good for investors to be aware of potential fundamental issues. Want to learn how to invest?
