<p>If anyone deserved a promotion, it's <strong>Adobe</strong> ( NASDAQ:ADBE ) CEO and president Shantanu Narayen. Coming off another stellar quarter and fiscal year, Narayen has <strong>Adobe</strong> soaring, and he's earned his recently announced position of board chairman to go alongside his roles as CEO and president. One of the reasons Narayen warrants his chairman role is <strong>Adobe</strong>'s constant pushing of the innovation envelope. <strong>Adobe</strong> has long held the distinction in the design community of being a leading packaged-software provider. But thanks to a few targeted acquisitions and internal development efforts, <strong>Adobe</strong> is now a cloud leader as well. A recent concept video speaks directly to <strong>Adobe</strong>'s willingness to explore new opportunities, despite what some pundits think. Shortly after <strong>Adobe</strong> shared a voice-editing feature it's exploring, it released a "concept video" demonstrating a similar functionality for images. The demo of a voice-activated digital assistant shows a user changing the size, framing, and saving of an image. The demo finishes with a voice command that instantly loads the edited pic onto the user's social-media page. A number of industry pundits chimed in with their disappointment in the feature, complaining about how "simplistic" it is. They missed the point entirely. There's a reason <strong>Adobe</strong> called it a concept video: The technology hasn't even progressed to the beta-testing stage. The demo was simply a way to introduce another of the innovations <strong>Adobe</strong> is undertaking to stay ahead of the curve. Some creative types also bemoaned the notion of having to learn another method -- in this case a voice-activated personal assistant -- for editing their projects. But there's a reason some of the biggest players in the tech industry, including <strong>Adobe</strong> strategic partner <strong>Microsoft</strong> ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , are testing voice-activated assistants incorporating artificial intelligence, like the Windows king's Cortana. According to one estimate, the use of virtual assistants will grow by nearly 35% annually over the next seven years, becoming a more than $11 billion market. As voice-activated tools like <strong>Adobe</strong>'s early-phase editing tool expand their capabilities, just as with Cortana, using the technology will become second nature. Setting the criticisms aside, <strong>Adobe</strong>'s editing demo speaks directly to its commitment to innovation. In addition to working together on incorporating virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) into <strong>Adobe</strong>'s design solutions -- a natural fit for creative folks -- the two companies recently partnered in the cloud, using <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s Azure platform to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics into <strong>Adobe</strong>'s Marketing Cloud solutions. Just as with its editing-assistant demo, the strategic alignment with <strong>Microsoft</strong> is an indication that <strong>Adobe</strong> has no intention of resting on its laurels, which should be music to the ears of investors -- particularly those concerned with <strong>Adobe</strong>'s incredible performance of late. Coming off a quarter and fiscal year in which <strong>Adobe</strong> reported record revenue of $1.61 billion and $5.85 billion respectively, its shareholders have enjoyed a 44% jump in stock price the past 12 months. Some may question <strong>Adobe</strong>'s relative value, given its trading at a whopping 49 times earnings. Don't. Due in part to continuously exploring cutting-edge new features and technologies, <strong>Adobe</strong> stock is trading at a mere 24 times forward earnings, less than half its current valuation. Another feather in <strong>Adobe</strong>'s cap is that its transition to an annual recurring revenue (ARR) model is hitting on all cylinders. <strong>Adobe</strong> exited last quarter with trailing ARR of $4.01 billion. In addition to building a strong, relatively stable revenue foundation, ARR also gives <strong>Adobe</strong> the flexibility to focus its spending on developing new advanced functionalities. Much of the 12.7% increase in operating expenses last year, which was more than offset by <strong>Adobe</strong>'s 22% increase in revenue, was spent on research and development. <strong>Adobe</strong>'s decision to act, rather than react, to the ever-changing possibilities offered by new technologies is a big reason it will continue to outperform its peers...despite what near-sighted pundits may think.
