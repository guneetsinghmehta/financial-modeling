<p>Research firm&nbsp; <strong>IHS Markit</strong> &nbsp;expects some very large, prominent companies &nbsp; including <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> and <strong>Home Depot</strong> to hike their dividends next week. Below are the four, from biggest potential increase to smallest, plus a few lines of Markit s commentary: <strong>Home Depot</strong> ( HD ) is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 14.5% to 79 cents a share. Analyst Kun Pu writes: As the whole US housing market is&nbsp;resuming its vigour, with the Case Shriller index reaching just 3% below its peak in&nbsp;2007, <strong>Home Depot</strong> is well positioned to benefit as the industry leader. Management&nbsp;recently guided its revenue growth of 4-5% and operating margin to improve 120bps in&nbsp;FY2018. As such, we maintain an optimistic outlook for a dividend jump on the way. <strong>Kohl s Corporation</strong> ( KSS )&nbsp;is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 10% to 55 cents a share. Analyst Roberto Soares writes: This&nbsp;represents a payout ratio in terms of consensus estimated EPS of approximately 58%, in line with its current dividend payout range of 55%-60%. As management reaffirmed&nbsp;its commitment to return value to shareholders by increasing share repurchase&nbsp;authorization, KSS is planning a buyback of $1bn, similar to the buybacks of $1.2bn and&nbsp;$2.3bn in the previous two years. <strong>Waste Management</strong> ( WM )&nbsp;is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 6.7% to&nbsp;43.75 cents a share. Analyst Santiago Mendez writes: Fundamentals are expected to improve compared to last year: earnings are&nbsp;expected to increase by around 15% in FY16, compared to a 5% last year, cash from&nbsp;operations is expected to rise by 20% and leverage is expected to decrease by around&nbsp;10%. This would make the company more likely to increase its dividend by a larger&nbsp;percentage than the 3% pattern it has been following for the last four years. <strong>Coca-Cola Company</strong> ( KO )&nbsp;is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 5.7% to 37 cents a share. Soares writes: KO s payout has increased to a high 60% of&nbsp;cash from operations as of lately, compared to historical payout in the low 50%. The&nbsp;uptick in payout primarily results from revenue decline, currency headwinds and&nbsp;structural changes &nbsp;We expect KO to be a little more&nbsp;conservative with future dividend increases, and we expect a slight increase of 5.7% to&nbsp;$0.37/qtr.
