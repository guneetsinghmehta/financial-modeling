YRC Worldwide’s ( YRCW ) Regional Transportation segment contributed ~37% to the company’s total operating revenues in 4Q16. In the same quarter, the segment’s revenue stood at $418.0 million—up 2.2% from $409.2 million in 4Q15. Notably, the 4Q16 had 60.5 workdays, as compared with 59.5 workdays in 4Q15. YRCW’s Regional Transportation segment is made up of Holland, New Penn, and Reddaway. The Holland service offers local next-day, regional, and expedited services through a network spread across 21 states in the US Midwest and Southeastern US. The New Penn service offers local next-day, day-definite, and time-bound services through a network in Northeastern US, Quebec and Puerto Rico. The Reddaway service provides local next-day and expedited services through a network spread out in California, the Southwest, Pacific Northeast, and Rocky Mountain regions. In YRCW’s Regional segment, the total tonnage per day (in thousands) remained unchanged on a YoY (year-over-year) basis in 4Q16. However, the total shipments per day (in thousands) fell 0.5% in the same quarter. The segment also witnessed a marginal rise of 0.6% in the total weight per shipment (in pounds), from 1,475 to 1,478, in 4Q16. YRCW’s management is mulling a consolidation of some of the Holland facilities into the New Penn and YRC. This might be done to share additional capacities, but the four regional entities would still act independently from the business perspective.
