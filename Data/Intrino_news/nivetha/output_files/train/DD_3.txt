<strong>DuPonts</strong> ( DD ) Performance Chemicals segment used PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acids) and its salts to manufacture fluoropolymer resins at various sites around the worldincluding its Washington Works plant in West Virginia. Prior to 2002, <strong>DuPont</strong> used to purchase PFOA from third parties for its manufacturing process. The EPA raised concerns about the safety of PFOA. As a result, major manufacturers like <strong>3M</strong> ( MMM ) stopped producing PFOA. <strong>DuPont</strong> decided to produce PFOA instead of purchasing it for manufacturing activities. It was alleged that <strong>DuPont</strong> dumped industrial waste from the PFOA manufacturing plant into the Ohio River. It contaminated the local drinking water. The contamination could cause diseases including cancer. In August 2001, a class action was filed against <strong>DuPont</strong> related to health issues due to exposure to PFOA in drinking water. The EPA looked into the issue and established a stewardship program. The program required its participants to reduce 95% of the PFOA in their products by 2010 and eliminate PFOA by 2015. The EPA announced a health advisory level of 0.4 parts per billion for PFOA in drinking water. In May 2016, it was changed to 0.07 parts per billion. During this time, there were ~3,500 lawsuits filed in various federal and state courts in Ohio and West Virginia related to several diseases. The above table shows the lawsuits against each of the diseases. On July 1, 2015, <strong>DuPont</strong> spun off its Performance Chemicals segment into a new company called <strong>Chemours</strong> ( CC ). There were talks that <strong>Chemours</strong> was spun-off to fail. All of the fluoro products processing facilities were moved under <strong>Chemours</strong>. With the spin-off of <strong>DuPonts</strong> Performance Chemicals segment, the loss that could arise from the lawsuits related to PFOA would impact Chemours. Investors can indirectly hold <strong>DuPont</strong> by investing in the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLB ). XLB invested 11.8% of its holdings in DuPont. The funds other top holdings include <strong>Dow Chemical</strong> ( DOW ) and <strong>Monsanto</strong> ( MON ). They have weights of 11.9% and 8.2% as of February 14, 2017. In the next part, well look at the settlement of the lawsuit related to PFOA. Quote data by <strong>Xignite</strong>
