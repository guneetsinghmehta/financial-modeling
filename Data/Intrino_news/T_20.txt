AT T’s (T) DIRECTV Now over-the-top (or OTT) is a new video streaming service that was launched in November 2016 with a headline promotional offer for its “Go Big” package ($35 a month for 100+ channels), which ended on January 9, 2017. Promotional pricing for DIRECTV Now saw strong initial adoption. AT T also reported approximately 200,000 video net additions driven entirely by DIRECTV Now in the service’s first month. The OTT video streaming service has a huge growth potential. Users have been subscribing to OTT services in greater numbers than ever before, mainly due to the high monthly bills that users are paying cable and satellite TV providers. A 3Q16 report from Digitalsmiths suggests that about 35.0% of users pay more than $100 every month to their pay-TV provider, as you can see in the above graph. AT T’s DIRECTV Now was supposed to stir up the video streaming market and steal market share from rivals such as Sling TV from Dish Network ( DISH ) and PlayStation Vue from Sony ( SNE ). AT T also looked at DIRECTV Now as a means to diversify its revenue streams beyond its traditional wireless business. However, it’s been a rocky launch for DIRECTV Now amid subscriber complaints. DIRECTV Now subscribers are complaining about technical glitches. Customers have reported that shows rarely stream from start to finish without crashing or freezing. According to a  Wall Street Journal  report, some customers say they will ditch DIRECTV Now if the problems persist. According to the report, others say they will give AT T the benefit of the doubt and allow it time to make the service better. Despite numerous media reports documenting the poor quality of the fledgling DIRECTV Now platform, AT T remains confident that it will rectify the issues. AT T’s other competitors in the video streaming space are Netflix ( NFLX ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) YouTube. Quote data by Xignite
