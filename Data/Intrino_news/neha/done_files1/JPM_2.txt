According to the median compiled by <strong>Bloomberg</strong>, iron ore prices will drop every quarter in 2017 to an average of $55 per ton in 4Q17. The main reasons extended by <strong>Bloomberg</strong> for this decline has mainly to do with asupply surge resulting from Vales ( VALE ) S11D, Roy Hill, Rio Tintos ( RIO ) Pilbara projects, and BHP Billitons ( BHP ) projectsas well as from tepid demand growth. While brokers have upgraded their short- to medium-term forecasts, theyre still not positive about the long-term fundamentals of the iron ore ( COMT ) ( DBC ). Like many other analysts, <strong>HSBC</strong> analyst David Plemingbelieves that iron ore cant sustain its run in the long-term. Plemingrecently stated: We believe the iron ore price will gradually correct itself through the course of 2017. However, Pleming added the following: Q1 being the seasonally strong period for iron ore, due to weather-related supply disruptions from the two major exporters (Australia and Brazil), the price momentum might be maintained in Q1. <strong>Citigroup</strong> (C) also believes we could see a sharp correction in iron ore prices this year, while <strong>RBC Capital Markets</strong> thinks that the current level of iron ore prices is simply unsustainable. <strong>Axiom</strong> analyst Gordon Johnson shares a similar view. He believes that strong restocking from China has pushed prices to irrational levels, which are soon to correct. Johnson added :should steel capacity in China come offline as inventory is being destocked, we feel this would push iron ore prices forcefully lower. Johnson projects that iron ore prices will average $57 per ton in 2017 and $45 per ton in 2018. But some analysts also hold a different view. According to<strong> J.P. Morgan</strong> ( JPM ), prices may average $73 per ton in 2017. Quote data by Xignite
