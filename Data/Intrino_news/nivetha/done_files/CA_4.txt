<p><strong>CA Technologies</strong> ( CA ) today announced it has been named an &ldquo; Overall Leader&rdquo; in Adaptive Authentication in the recently released Leadership Compass report from KuppingerCole, a leading analyst firm for identity and access management. CA Advanced Authentication was evaluated for the report, which assessed solutions focused on adaptive authentication &mdash; the process of gathering additional attributes about users and their environments and evaluating the attributes in the context of risk-based policies. &ldquo;CA Advanced Authentication is quite flexible: it is available as a standalone product, but also integrates with CA&rsquo;s and other IAM vendors&rsquo; products. It can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, where it is fully multi-tenant,&rdquo; John Tolbert, lead analyst at KuppingerCole, wrote in the report. &ldquo;With a risk engine that analyzes up to 200 risk factors, and a self-learning user behavior profiling capability to facilitate continuous authentication, CA Advanced Authentication is a clear pick for shortlists when looking for an adaptive authentication solution.&rdquo; In the &ldquo; Leadership Compass: Adaptive Authentication &rdquo;* report, KuppingerCole calculated leaders in four categories: innovation, market presence, product and &ldquo;overall.&rdquo; Overall leaders were determined based on a combined rating of innovation, market presence and product.
