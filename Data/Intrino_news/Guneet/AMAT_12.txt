<p>BREAKING: &nbsp;Dow, S P 500 Stay Down; Nasdaq Inches Into Positive Ground Need to register? Current subscribers register here . The major indexes turned negative after reversing from record highs as they threatened to kill a seven-day winning streak. In early trading, investors focused on upbeat jobless claims data that saw claims rise to 239,000 last week vs. an expected 246,000. The Nasdaq and S P 500 fell 0.2% each, while the Dow Jones industrial average edged down 0.1%. Through morning trading, volume was tracking lower across both exchanges vs. the same time Wednesday. Within the blue-chip index, <strong>Cisco</strong> ( CSCO ) led the way with a 3% surge to the upside following its &nbsp;Q2 earnings report that saw the networking giant surpass top- and bottom-line estimates. <strong>Cisco</strong> also continued its pattern of raising its dividend, bumping it up three cents to 29 cents per share. Shares are now almost 6% above a 32.05 flat-base entry. <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ), a Dow component, remained quiet in the &nbsp;stock market today , trading down 0.3%. Among companies that reported earnings Wednesday, &nbsp;<strong>NetEase</strong> ( NTES ) surged over 12% after easily beating both earnings and sales estimates due to strength in mobile gaming. The Chinese gaming stock remained within its cup with handle's 257.78 buy zone on Wednesday. <strong>Applied Materials</strong> ( AMAT ) recovered some of its early losses to trade down 0.7% after the company beat expectations on its fiscal Q1 results late Wednesday. Another China-based stock showed quality price action Thursday as well: <strong>Weibo</strong> ( WB ), the <strong>Twitter</strong> of China, jumped 2% to achieve a record high, though gains have been pared. Shares are now extended from the 52.59 double-bottom buy point. The IBD 50 , a screen of leading growth stocks, showed mostly negative action after the general market's reversal from highs. Only five stocks were trading in the green. Broad weakness in the financial sector led to losses among regional banks and online brokers. <strong>Zions Bancorp</strong> ( ZION ) and <strong>Charles Schwab</strong> ( SCHW ) both fell about 1.4% each. On the upside, besides <strong>NetEase</strong>, <strong>Momo</strong> ( MOMO ) traded up 1.6% as it continues to act well post-breakout. The Chinese social-media platform is 11% above a 23.96 cup-with-handle entry. On the downside, <strong>Nvidia</strong> ( NVDA ) &nbsp;and<strong> Veeva Systems</strong> ( VEEV ) led the decliners, falling about 2% each. After a failed breakout last week, Nvidia is back at its 10-week line. Veeva continues to build a base, but its RS line has fallen sharply over the last several months.
