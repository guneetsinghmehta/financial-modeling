Its operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 37.43% to 36.35%. This decline in earnings would have been worse except for the fact that the company showed improvement in gross margins, from 76.79% to 78.45%. For comparison, gross margins were 78.78% and EBITDA margins 41.65% in the immediate last period. Quadrant label definitions.

Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet. CA-US s gross margin improvement has not produced any big difference in its working capital. Working capital days are currently 75.46, compared to last year s level of 71.07 days. This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the improvements in gross margins are likely from operating decisions and not trade-offs with the balance sheet. Quadrant label definitions.

CA-US s change in operating cash flow of 55.72% compared to the same period last year is about the same as its change in earnings this period. Additionally, this change in operating cash flow is about average among its peer group. This suggests that the company did not use accruals or reserves to manage earnings this period, and that, all else being equal, the earnings number is sustainable. Quadrant label definitions.

As a matter of fact, the company showed increases in operating (EBIT) and pretax margins. EBIT margins improved from 28.53% to 28.90% and pretax margins widened from 26.89% to 29.00%.
