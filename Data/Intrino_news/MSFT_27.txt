Salesforce ( CRM ), which is seeking to double its revenues to $20 billion by 2021–2022, recently announced a new innovation hub in Seattle. The hub will be located between the city’s Amazon ( AMZN ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) offices, a move that is widely seen as symbolic. The move comes after Salesforce inked a $400 million deal to use Amazon’s cloud, Amazon Web Service (or AWS). The deal with Amazon was interpreted as a loss for Microsoft because it would have wanted Salesforce to choose its Azure cloud instead of AWS. Salesforce’s choice of AWS over Azure also signaled the growing rift between the company and Microsoft amid signs of escalating rivalry. Both companies are seeking to control the enterprise software market. Salesforce interests also clash with those of Oracle ( ORCL ) and SAP SE ( SAP ), another enterprise software vendor. Salesforce said its Seattle innovation hub would be a world-class office. While the company hasn’t disclosed everything about its plans for the hub, it could be a place to build an even stronger relationship with Amazon at Microsoft’s expense. After launching as a primarily customer relationship management (or CRM) software vendor, Salesforce has expanded into related fields such as marketing, user productivity, and e-commerce. These moves, which have been made possible through a series of strategic acquisitions such as Quip, ExactTarget, and Demandware, have rattled incumbents in those fields. Salesforce is expected to report its fiscal 4Q17 results on February 28, after the market closes. The company topped market expectations in fiscal 3Q17. Quote data by Xignite
