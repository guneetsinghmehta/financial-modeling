Feb 13 (Reuters) - <strong>DuPont</strong> said on Monday it agreed to pay $670.7 million in cash to settle several lawsuits related to a chemical leak from a plant in West Virginia. The company said it settled about 3,550 personal injury claims arising from the leak of perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as PFOA or C-8, from <strong>DuPont's</strong> Parkersburg, West Virginia, plant. The leak allegedly contaminated local water supplies and has been linked to six diseases, including testicular and kidney cancers. <strong>DuPont</strong> has used C-8 at the West Virginia plant since the early 1950s. The chemical is used to make Teflon. Titanium dioxide maker <strong>Chemours Co,</strong>which was spun off from <strong>DuPont</strong>, said it will pay half of the settlement. Both companies denied any wrongdoing.
