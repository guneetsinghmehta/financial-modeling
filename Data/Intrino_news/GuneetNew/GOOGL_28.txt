<p><strong>Alphabet</strong> ( GOOGL ) didn&rsquo;t explain in much detail why it decided to rehire artificial intelligence (or AI) and robotics specialist Yoky Matsuoka. Matsuoka cofounded <strong>Google</strong> X but left to work for <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ). She is returning to <strong>Alphabet</strong> as the chief technology officer of Nest, <strong>Alphabet&rsquo;s</strong> smart home unit. Matsuoka&rsquo;s return could give a significant boost to <strong>Google</strong> Home, <strong>Alphabet&rsquo;s</strong> home automation hub that competes with Echo by <strong>Amazon</strong> ( AMZN ). Nest has only begun to integrate <strong>Google</strong> Assistant into its products so that they can be operated via <strong>Google</strong> Home. With Matsuoka&rsquo;s AI expertise, the integration could be faster and better, possibly expanding the application of <strong>Google</strong> Home. <strong>Nest&rsquo;s</strong> products include a smart thermostat and smoke detector that it sells domestically and abroad. <strong>Nest</strong> recently announced its expansion into four European countries, including Germany and Italy. According to the head of <strong>Nest</strong> Europe, Lionel Paillet, <strong>Nest&rsquo;s</strong> business is growing rapidly at an annual rate of 50%. Integrating <strong>Google</strong> Assistant into <strong>Nest</strong> products would expand the market for <strong>Google</strong> Home, as existing Nest product owners could easily control their smart appliances. <strong>Google</strong> Home supports voice control of connected devices. By riding on <strong>Nest&rsquo;s</strong> rails, which extend overseas, <strong>Google</strong> Home could give Echo a serious run for its money in the home automation systems market. As <strong>Alphabet</strong> faces growing competition from <strong>Facebook</strong> ( FB ), <strong>Twitter</strong> ( TWTR ), <strong>Microsoft&rsquo;s</strong> ( MSFT ) <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, and <strong>Yelp</strong> ( YELP ) for online advertising spending, the company may need to venture into nonadvertising businesses to secure its future. This shift could explain the rationale behind projects such as <strong>Nest</strong>, <strong>Waymo</strong> , and <strong>Google</strong> Cloud. Quote data by <strong>Xignite</strong></p>
