New Zealand is doing to Microsoft ( MSFT ) what European Union authorities have been doing to American companies lately: questioning their tax practices. New Zealand’s tax agency, Inland Revenue, is reviewing transfer pricing transactions between Microsoft and its local subsidiary. Microsoft moved the ownership of its New Zealand unit to Luxembourg in 2014. Aside from Ireland, Luxembourg is another popular tax haven in the EU for companies trying to lower their tax burdens, but such tax maneuvers have attracted rebukes from EU authorities. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, is now pursuing Apple ( AAPL ) for allegedly striking an illicit tax deal with the government of Ireland that allowed it to pay tax on only a fraction of profits earned in Ireland. Both Apple and Ireland have protested EU’s tax charges, but now the EU is also scrutinizing the Eurozone tax practices of Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and McDonald’s ( MCD ). As for Microsoft in New Zealand, the tax authority is auditing the transfer pricing payments between the company and the domestic subsidiary on suspicions that Microsoft may be overcharging the New Zealand unit for back-office services as a scheme to move profits earned in New Zealand to jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower. Some of the back-office services parent companies offer their subsidies are marketing and accounting support. Microsoft could be forced to pay to settle with New Zealand if the audit reveals an illicit tax maneuver. Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) Google and Facebook ( FB ) also have operations in New Zealand, but their presence in the market is smaller than that of Microsoft. Quote data by Xignite
