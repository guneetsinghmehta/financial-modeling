<p>InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice Trading Tips Since going public in 1999, the asset management firm known as <strong>BlackRock Inc</strong>. (NYSE: BLK ) has been the best investment of the 21st century. Yes, it's better than <strong>Amazon</strong>.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), a lot better. It's up 2,670% in that time, and it has been paying dividends in a rising stream since 2003. Payouts&nbsp;started at 20 cents per share and now bring in $2.50 each quarter. An income investor who got in on the 1999 IPO, paying $14 per share, is now collecting $10 per share in dividends each year. Some of the capital gains are a trick of the light. <strong>BlackRock</strong> did not participate in the "dot-bomb," the collapse of Internet stocks that began in early 2000 after <strong>Time Warner Inc</strong> &nbsp;(NYSE: TWX ) gave AOL 60% of its equity in a merger. <strong>BlackRock</strong> doubled in value that year. If you start calculating after the dot-bomb wreckage cleared, <strong>BlackRock</strong> is up "only" 1,000%, against a nearly 5,400% gain for<strong> Amazon</strong> during that time. <strong>Alphabet Inc</strong> (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has also outpaced it since going public in 2004. The point is that with few exceptions, like the 2008 stock market collapse, the value of BLK stock&nbsp;has consistently increased. And, even during that crisis - where its market cap was cut in half and other companies&nbsp;collapsed completely - <strong>BlackRock</strong> did not cut that dividend. CEO and co-founder Larry Fink is not often mentioned in the same breath as bankers like Jamie Dimon of <strong>JPMorgan Chase Co</strong>. (NYSE: JPM ) or Lloyd Blankfein of <strong>Goldman Sachs Group Inc</strong> &nbsp;(NYSE: GS ); he just does better for his investors. <strong>BlackRock</strong> was founded in 1988 &nbsp;with operating capital from Pete Peterson of the <strong>Blackstone Group</strong>, from which it separated in 1995 after a dispute with Stephen Schwarzmann , orchestrated with <strong>PNC Financial Services Group Inc</strong> &nbsp;(NYSE: PNC ), whose investment arm came into <strong>BlackRock</strong> in 1998. BLK&nbsp;went public a year later at $14 per share. Since then, Fink has gone from strength to strength. <strong>BlackRock</strong> was hired to clean up the mess of the 2008 meltdown. <strong>BlackRock Solutions</strong> unwound the toxic mortgage assets. Plus, the same year it was hired for that job (2009), <strong>BlackRock</strong> acquired <strong>Barclays Global Investors</strong> and its iShares franchise. <strong>BlackRock</strong>'s tech assets include <strong>Aladdin</strong>, an investment system from <strong>BlackRock Solutions</strong>, and <strong>iRetire</strong> , a retirement investment framework offered by other financial advisors. As<strong> BlackRock</strong> has grown, it has developed a knack for taking deals others wouldn't even consider -&nbsp;and making them work. Right now, for instance, <strong>BlackRock</strong> is spending $500 million renovating the Willis (nee Sears) Tower in Chicago. In 2015, BLK&nbsp;bought the 108-story landmark, the world's tallest building when completed in 1973, for $1.3 billion. For <strong>BlackRock</strong>, that's a small deal, actually. It's currently buying First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Funds, a $3.7 billion owner of income-producing energy projects like mid-stream pipelines,&nbsp;grabbing for Trump's infrastructure money with both hands . Fink is skeptical of the Trump rally, and of the President's&nbsp;plans for the dollar.&nbsp;Fink still loves the Mexican peso&nbsp;and is worried about the future of the global economy in the age of Trump. But, <strong>BlackRock</strong> keeps politics and business separate, its response to the travel ban mainly a letter to employees. <strong>BlackRock</strong>'s ETF business has more than $1 trillion in assets. &nbsp;It considers Russia a buy,&nbsp;but is skeptical of Brexit, even while former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne joins BLK&nbsp;as an adviser. During the fourth quarter of 2016,<strong> BlackRock</strong> again beat analyst estimates , earning $852 million, $5.14 per share, on revenue of $2.89 billion. It brought approximately&nbsp;one-third of revenue to the net income line because most of its money came&nbsp;in the form of investment advisory fees, from administration fees and securities lending. When <strong>BlackRock</strong> plunges into a stock, it can hold up, despite real business pressures. An example is&nbsp; <strong>GoPro Inc</strong> &nbsp;(NASDAQ: GPRO ) - without <strong>BlackRock</strong>'s investment, the company might be worthless now. Similarly, BLK's&nbsp;growing investment in <strong>First Data Corp</strong> (NYSE: FDC ), the transaction processing company, also made headlines . <strong>BlackRock</strong> operates passively, and its growth - considering the sheer size of its investment portfolio -&nbsp; concerns some reporters and regulators. &nbsp;Don't let yourself be counted among them. This is one of those stocks which, like <strong>Apple Inc</strong>. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), you can buy, put away and generally ignore, while still remaining confident of solid returns. BLK stock has a 20-year track record of stellar performance, and the founders remain at their desks. Dana Blankenhorn &nbsp;is a financial and technology journalist.
