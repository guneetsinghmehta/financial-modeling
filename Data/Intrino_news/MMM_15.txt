3M CO 9-Feb-2017 Annual Report Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (MD A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M's financial statements
with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M's MD A is presented in
eight sections:  Overview  Results of Operations  Performance by Business Segment  Performance by Geographic Area  Critical Accounting Estimates  New Accounting Pronouncements  Financial Condition and Liquidity  Financial Instruments Forward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that
could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the
section entitled Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future
Results in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of
these risks and uncertainties). OVERVIEW 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a
wide variety of products and services. As described in Note 16, effective in
the first quarter of 2016, 3M made a product line reporting change involving two
of its business segments. Segment information presented herein reflects the
impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in
five operating business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care;
Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any
references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.
Any references to Membrana refer to the former Separations Media business
acquired by 3M from Polypore in 2015. Earnings per share (EPS) attributable to 3M common shareholders - diluted: The following table provides the increase (decrease) in diluted earnings per
share for 2016 compared to 2015, and 2015 compared to 2014. Year ended December 31,
(Earnings per diluted share) 2016 2015
Same period last year $ 7.58 $ 7.49
Increase/(decrease) in earnings per share - diluted, due to:

Shares of common stock outstanding 0.24 0.28
Current period $ 8.16 $ 7.58 Year 2016 versus Year 2015 EPS: For total year 2016, net income attributable to 3M was $5.050 billion, or $8.16
per diluted share, compared to $4.833 billion, or $7.58 per diluted share, in
2015, an increase of 7.7 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational
benefits increased earnings, helped by lower defined benefit pension and
postretirement expenses. Operational benefits also included the combination of
higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, in addition to productivity
benefits Table of Contents related to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. These operational benefits
were partially offset by the impact of flat organic sales and lower asset
utilization. Restructuring actions resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents
per diluted share in 2015, which provided a year-on-year benefit in 2016. Acquisition and divestiture impacts, which are measured for the first twelve
months post-transaction, related to the acquisitions of Membrana and Capital
Safety (third quarter 2015) and Semfinder (September 2016), and the divestitures
of Polyfoam (first quarter 2016), the library systems business (fourth quarter
2015/first quarter 2016), and the license plate converting business in France
(fourth quarter 2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the
assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology
out-licensing business. On a combined basis, these acquisition/divestiture
year-on-year impacts resulted in a 14 cents per diluted share benefit to
earnings per share in 2016, driven by solid performances from 2015 acquisitions
and year-on-year divestiture gains. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of
these acquisition/divestiture impacts. Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by
approximately $127 million year-on-year in 2016, excluding the impact of foreign
currency changes on tax rates. This is equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of
14 cents per diluted share for 2016. Over the past few years, 3M has taken actions to better optimize its capital
structure and reduce its cost of capital by adding debt. These actions have led
to an increase in interest expense year-on-year in 2016, largely due to higher
average debt balances. The income tax rate was 28.3 percent in 2016, a decline of 0.8 percentage points
versus last year. The 2016 change in tax rate was driven by a number of factors
as referenced in Note 8, including the first quarter 2016 adoption of Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09 (discussed in Note 1). Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2016 declined 3 percent versus
last year, which benefited earnings per share. The benefits from share
repurchases, net of issuances, were partially offset by the adoption of ASU No.
2016-09, which increased the calculated number of diluted shares in 2016. Refer to the section entitled Results of Operations for further discussion. Year 2015 versus Year 2014 EPS: For total year 2015, net income attributable to 3M was $4.833 billion, or $7.58
per diluted share, compared to $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per diluted share, in
2014, an increase of 1.2 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational
benefits include the combination of selling price increases and raw material
cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs.
Restructuring actions (discussed in Note 4) resulted in an after-tax charge of
14 cents per diluted share. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate
to the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions, and the divestitures of the
license plate converting business in France and substantially all of the library
systems business. Foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share
by approximately 43 cents year-on-year, driven by average year-on-year changes
in foreign exchange rates in the Euro of 17 percent, Yen of 12 percent, and
Brazil Real of 30 percent. The income tax rate was largely unchanged
year-on-year. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2015 declined 3.7
percent year-on-year to 637.2 million, which increased earnings per diluted
share by approximately 28 cents. Refer to the section entitled Results of
Operations for further discussion. Fourth-quarter 2016 sales and operating income results: Fourth-quarter 2016 net income attributable to 3M was $1.155 billion, or $1.88
per diluted share, compared to $1.038 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, in
the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth-quarter 2016 sales totaled $7.3 billion, an
increase of 0.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. Organic-local currency
sales increased 1.6 percent, with organic volume increases of 1.5 percent and
higher selling prices contributing 0.1 percent. Divestitures reduced sales by
0.4 percent, which related to the fourth quarter 2015 sale of both the license
plate converting business in France, along with substantially all of the library
systems business. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets
of its Table of Contents protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing
business. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8 percent
year-on-year. From a business segment perspective, 3M achieved organic local-currency sales
growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) in Industrial,
Safety and Graphics, and Health Care, with declines in Electronics and Energy,
and Consumer. On an organic local-currency sales basis:  Sales increased 4.6 percent in Industrial, with sales growth led by automotive
OEM, advanced materials, separation and purification, and automotive
aftermarket. Sales declined in aerospace and commercial transportation.  Sales increased 2.2 percent in Safety and Graphics, with sales increases in
roofing granules, personal safety, and commercial solutions. Sales declined in
traffic safety and security.  Sales increased 1.3 percent in Health Care, with sales increases in food
safety, critical and chronic care, drug delivery systems, and infection
prevention. Sales declined slightly in oral care, as this business continued to
be impacted by soft end-market conditions and channel inventory adjustments.
Health information systems also declined due to a slower rate of software
installations in a tougher market over the past year, along with a challenging
comparison against last year's fourth quarter.  Sales decreased 0.6 percent in Electronics and Energy. Electronics-related
sales were flat, with growth in electronics materials solutions more than
offset by a decline in display materials and systems. This was an improvement
over recent quarters as end-market conditions and channel inventories became
more stable. Energy-related sales declined 2 percent as growth in
telecommunications markets was offset by declines in electrical markets, and
renewable energy. In December 2015, 3M exited its backsheet business in
renewable energy, which reduced energy-related organic sales by 3.5 percent
year-on-year.  Sales decreased 0.7 percent in the Consumer business segment. Despite channel
inventory adjustments, 3M posted organic growth in the home improvement,
consumer health care, and home care businesses. The stationery and office
supplies business, which was most impacted by channel inventory adjustments,
declined year-on-year. From a geographic area perspective, fourth-quarter 2016 organic local-currency
sales increased in Latin America/Canada, Asia Pacific, and the United States.
Organic local-currency sales declined in EMEA. On an organic local-currency sales basis:  Sales in Latin America/Canada increased 4.1 percent. 3M saw growth in four of
its five business segments, led by Health Care. Sales in Mexico increased 10
percent, Canada was up 3 percent and Brazil increased 1 percent.  Sales in Asia Pacific increased 2.4 percent, led by Health Care and Consumer.
This growth was partially offset by a decline in Electronics and Energy. Within
Asia Pacific, sales increased 6 percent in China/Hong Kong, and increased 3
percent in Japan. Excluding our electronics-related businesses, China/Hong Kong
was up 11 percent and Japan grew 2 percent.  Organic local-currency sales in the United States increased 1.2 percent, led by
Industrial, Health Care, and Safety and Graphics.  Organic local-currency sales in EMEA declined 2.4 percent. West Europe declined
1 percent, as growth in Safety and Graphics, and Industrial, was more than
offset by declines in other business groups. Central East Europe and Middle
East Africa declined 6 percent, impacted by ongoing challenges in Saudi Arabia
and Turkey, which 3M expects to persist in the near term. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 22.7 percent of sales,
compared to 20.5 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of
2.2 percentage points. The year-on-year comparison related to 2015 restructuring
charges increased operating income margins by 1.6 percentage points. In
addition, lower pension/postretirement benefit costs, raw material cost
decreases, year-on-year divestiture gains, and productivity benefits improved
operating income margins. These benefits were partially offset by strategic
investments and legal costs, with these items discussed on an annual basis in
the Operating income margin section. Table of Contents Year 2016 sales and operating income results: Sales totaled $30.1 billion, a decrease of 0.5 percent from 2015. Organic
local-currency sales declined 0.1 percent, with organic volumes declines of 0.8
percent largely offset by selling price increases of 0.7 percent. Acquisitions
added 1.2 percent to sales, while divestitures reduced sales by 0.4 percent.
Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.2 percent year-on-year. From a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales increased 3.5
percent in Health Care, 2.2 percent in Safety and Graphics, 1.9 percent in
Consumer, and were flat in Industrial, while sales declined 7.5 percent in
Electronics and Energy. From a geographic area perspective, 2016 organic
local-currency sales grew 3.7 percent in Latin America/Canada, 0.5 percent in
the United States, 0.4 percent in EMEA, and declined 2.8 percent in Asia
Pacific. Refer to the sections entitled Performance by Business Segment and Performance by Geographic Area for additional detail. Operating income in 2016 was 24.0 percent of sales, compared to 22.9 percent of
sales in 2015, an increase of 1.1 percentage points. Restructuring actions
resulted in a pre-tax charge of $114 million in 2015, which provided a
year-on-year benefit in 2016. These results also included a benefit from the
combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, plus
lower pension/postretirement benefit costs. Refer to the section entitled Results of Operations for further discussion. Year 2015 sales and operating income results: Sales totaled $30.3 billion, a decrease of 4.9 percent from 2014. Organic
local-currency sales grew 1.3 percent, with higher organic volumes contributing
0.2 percent and selling price increases contributing 1.1 percent. Acquisitions
added 0.8 percent to sales, while divestitures reduced sales by 0.2 percent.
Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 6.8 percent year-on-year. From a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales increased 3.7
percent in Health Care, 3.4 percent in Consumer, 2.4 percent in Safety and
Graphics, and 0.4 percent in Industrial, while sales declined 1.5 percent in
Electronics and Energy. From a geographic area perspective, 2015 organic
local-currency sales grew 2.1 percent in the United States, 1.5 percent in Latin
America/Canada, 0.9 percent in Asia Pacific, and 0.8 percent in EMEA. Refer to
the sections entitled Performance by Business Segment and Performance by
Geographic Area for additional detail. Operating income in 2015 was 22.9 percent of sales, compared to 22.4 percent of
sales in 2014, an increase of 0.5 percentage points. These results included a
benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost
decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs and
2015 restructuring charges. Refer to the section entitled Results of
Operations for further discussion. Table of Contents Sales and operating income by business segment: The following tables contain sales and operating income results by business
segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. In addition to the

segments posted operating income margins of more than 21 percent in 2015.
Worldwide operating income margins for 2015 were 22.9 percent, compared to 22.4
percent for 2014. Financial condition: 3M generated $6.7 billion of operating cash flow in 2016, an increase of $242
million when compared to 2015. This followed a decrease of $206 million when
comparing 2015 to 2014. Refer to the section entitled Financial Condition and
Liquidity later in MD A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In
February 2016, 3M's Board of Table of Contents Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M's outstanding
common stock, which replaced the Company's February 2014 repurchase program.
This new program has no pre-established end date. In 2016, the Company purchased
$3.75 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of more than $5 billion of
its own stock each year in 2015 and 2014. The Company expects to purchase $2.5
billion to $4.5 billion of its own stock in 2017. In February 2017, 3M's Board
of Directors declared a first-quarter 2017 dividend of $1.175 per share, an
increase of 6 percent. This marked the 59th consecutive year of dividend
increases for 3M. 3M's debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as
debt plus equity) was 53 percent at December 31, 2016, 48 percent at
December 31, 2015, and 35 percent at December 31, 2014. The Company has an AA-
credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard Poor's and an A1 credit
rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody's Investors Service. The Company
generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets
funding throughout business cycles. Raw materials: In 2016, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material
categories and transportation fuel, due largely to price decreases in crude oil
and the derivative chemical feedstock markets. This in turn drove year-on-year
cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based
materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date the Company is
receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably
foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future
shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has
avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of
existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of
additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through
negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price
swaps. Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans: On a worldwide basis, 3M's pension and postretirement plans were 84 percent
funded at year-end 2016. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is
approximately 68 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 90 percent
funded and the international pension plans were 85 percent funded. The U.S.
non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other
factors. Asset returns in 2016 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were
5.8%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income
matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified
pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for
2017 is 7.25%, down 0.25% from 2016. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan
year-end 2016 discount rate was 4.21%, down 0.26 percentage points from the
year-end 2015 discount rate of 4.47%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates
resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO).
The plan's funded status decreased slightly in 2016 as the growth in the PBO
increased at a greater rate than the plan assets returned in 2016. Additional
detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is
provided in Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans). 3M expects to contribute approximately $300 million to $500 million of cash to
its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2017. The Company
does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its
U.S. plans in 2017. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement
expense in 2017 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits
and other) to increase by approximately $74 million pre-tax when compared to
2016. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates within MD A and Note 11 (Pension
and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M's
pension and post-retirement plans. Beginning on January 1, 2016, with respect to defined contribution plans, the
Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions for U.S. employees.
Previously, based on the date the employee was hired, up to 6% of eligible
compensation was matched in cash at rates of 60%, 75% or 100%. Beginning in
2016, 5% of eligible compensation is matched at rates of 45%, 60% or 100%,
respectively. The reduction in the company's match reduced 2016 defined
contribution pension expense by approximately $30 million. Year 2017 announced divestitures: In December 2016, 3M (Safety and Graphics Business) announced that it agreed to
sell its identity management business. The transaction is expected to close
during the first half of 2017. In January 2017, 3M (Safety and Graphics Table of Contents Business) sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business. The
Company expects a pre-tax gain of approximately $500 million in 2017 as a result
of these two divestitures. Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales: 2016 2015 U.S. Intl. Worldwide U.S. Intl. Worldwide
