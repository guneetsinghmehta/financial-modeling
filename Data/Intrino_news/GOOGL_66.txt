JOSH EDELSON/AFP/Getty Images After the close of trading last night, Apple investors received news via 13F filings from the likes of Berkshire Hathaway and Elliott Management, among others, that showed that holdings of Apple among the biggest institutions had increased significantly in the December quarter. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had increased its stake in Apple from 15.2 million shares at the end of Q3:16 to 57.4 million at the end of the December quarter, an increase of 322%. Elliott Management increased its own stake in Apple by 122%, taking it from 1.39 million shares at the end of the third quarter in 2016 to 2.57 million shares at the end of the fourth quarter last year. On the flip side, Tiger Global sold its entire Apple stake of 3.6 million shares in Q4. Julian Robertson is probably pretty upset at that decision, in hindsight. C'est la vie. Already, there is chatter among the nawabs of negativity that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway could have already sold its stake in Apple, given the rise in the shares in the last month or so. Don't be fooled by that one bit. Buffett is not in Apple for the $1.1 billion or so that he has made on paper thus far in 2017 from his Apple investment. In fact, the opposite could be true. He might have added even more shares this quarter after Apple's stellar results a couple of weeks ago. We will find out when the 13Fs are filed in the middle of May for Q1:17. Watch on Forbes: Shares of Apple are currently trading up $1 per share at $136 and change in very early pre-market trading activity on slightly more than 14,000 share volume. Apple stock has outperformed thus far in 2017, but is still a major laggard, given the fact that its current price-to-earnings multiple is at a significant discount to the indices. Apple shares are valued at 13x next year's earnings of $10.13 per share, compared to Microsoft, which currently trades at 20x next year's estimated earnings of $3.26 per share. Microsoft is expected to grow its top line by 7% next year, versus 8% expected growth in revenues for Apple for the game period. Bottom-line growth for Microsoft is estimated at 7% and for Apple at 13.5%. So, why the discount in Apple relative to Microsoft, given better growth rates? Something to think about. So, yet again we are faced with the same quandary from a month ago, before Apple released earnings for its December quarter: Apple: A buy at current levels or a buy at higher prices?
