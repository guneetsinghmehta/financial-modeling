Currency headwinds, competition from online retailers like Amazon ( AMZN ), and food deflation have been putting pressure on Walmart’s revenue in recent quarters. Walmart has been taking several initiatives to improve its performance including enhancing its e-commerce channels, raising wages, and remodeling stores. Walmart ( WMT ) has delivered nine consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth as of fiscal 3Q17, which ended on October 31, 2016. Walmart’s revenue rose 0.7% on a year-over-year basis to $118.2 billion in fiscal 3Q17, lagging the consensus analyst estimate of $118.7 billion. Walmart’s revenue consists of net sales from its stores, membership fees, and other income. In fiscal 3Q17, the company’s net sales rose 0.5% to $117.2 billion. Walmart’s membership fees and other income rose 23.8% to $1.0 billion in fiscal 3Q17, mainly due to an $86 million gain from the sale of certain shopping malls in Chile. Walmart’s same-store sales growth was 1.2% in fiscal 3Q17. In fiscal 3Q17, Walmart’s US business performed better than its international operations. Walmart US, the company’s largest segment, delivered sales growth of 2.5% in fiscal 3Q17, driven by a rise in retail square feet, higher consumer traffic, and increased e-commerce sales. Despite lower fuel sales resulting from a fall in fuel prices, the company’s Sam’s Club segment saw 1.1% growth in its 3Q17 sales. Walmart’s International segment continued to be shadowed by currency headwinds. In fiscal 3Q17, the international segment’s net sales fell 4.8% due to the $2.1 billion impact of adverse currency fluctuations. Analysts expect Walmart’s fiscal 4Q17 revenue to rise 1.3% to $131.4 billion and full-year fiscal 2017 revenue to rise 0.8% to $486.1 billion. Based on the guidance issued by Walmart in November 2016, the company expects the same-store sales for its Walmart US segment to rise 1.0% to 1.5% in fiscal 4Q17. The same-store sales for the Sam’s Club business, excluding fuel sales, are also expected to rise by 1.0% to 1.5% in fiscal 4Q17. Target ( TGT ), which is scheduled to announce its fiscal 4Q16 results on February 28, is expected to report a 4% decline in its sales. Kroger ( KR ), which is scheduled to announce its fiscal 4Q16 results on March 2, is expected to deliver sales growth of 4.4%.
