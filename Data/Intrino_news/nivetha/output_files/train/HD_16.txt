Research firm <strong>IHS Markit</strong> expects some very large, prominent companies including <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> and <strong>Home Depot</strong> to hike their dividends next week. Below are the four, from biggest potential increase to smallest, plus a few lines of Markit s commentary: <strong>Home Depot</strong> ( HD ) is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 14.5% to 79 cents a share. Analyst Kun Pu writes: As the whole US housing market isresuming its vigour, with the Case Shriller index reaching just 3% below its peak in2007, <strong>Home Depot</strong> is well positioned to benefit as the industry leader. Managementrecently guided its revenue growth of 4-5% and operating margin to improve 120bps inFY2018. As such, we maintain an optimistic outlook for a dividend jump on the way. <strong>Kohl s Corporation</strong> ( KSS )is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 10% to 55 cents a share. Analyst Roberto Soares writes: Thisrepresents a payout ratio in terms of consensus estimated EPS of approximately 58%, in line with its current dividend payout range of 55%-60%. As management reaffirmedits commitment to return value to shareholders by increasing share repurchaseauthorization, KSS is planning a buyback of $1bn, similar to the buybacks of $1.2bn and$2.3bn in the previous two years. <strong>Waste Management</strong> ( WM )is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 6.7% to43.75 cents a share. Analyst Santiago Mendez writes: Fundamentals are expected to improve compared to last year: earnings areexpected to increase by around 15% in FY16, compared to a 5% last year, cash fromoperations is expected to rise by 20% and leverage is expected to decrease by around10%. This would make the company more likely to increase its dividend by a largerpercentage than the 3% pattern it has been following for the last four years. <strong>Coca-Cola Company</strong> ( KO )is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 5.7% to 37 cents a share. Soares writes: KO s payout has increased to a high 60% ofcash from operations as of lately, compared to historical payout in the low 50%. Theuptick in payout primarily results from revenue decline, currency headwinds andstructural changes We expect KO to be a little moreconservative with future dividend increases, and we expect a slight increase of 5.7% to$0.37/qtr.
