In the earlier parts of the series, we looked at integrated energy stocks’ price performance and dividend yields. Now, in this part, we’ll compare integrated energy stocks in terms of forward valuations. The forward EV-to-EBITDA and price-to-earnings (or PE) averages of ExxonMobil ( XOM ), Chevron ( CVX ), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A), and BP ( BP ), the four top integrated energy companies we’ve been analyzing in this series, stand at 6.5x and 17.8x, respectively. XOM trades at 8.1x forward EV to EBITDA and 19.6x forward price to earnings, which are both above the peer averages. Similarly, CVX trades above peer averages on both parameters. The valuation premiums that both the companies command are likely because they are better placed in terms of leverage compared to Shell and BP. Shell and BP trade below their peer averages on both parameters. Both had a steep rise in their debt levels in the past few years due to lower oil prices and other events like the Gulf of Mexico oil spill charges in the case of BP and the acquisition of BG Group in the case of Shell. BP’s and Shell’s lower valuations also affect the FTSE 100 Index. BP ( BP ) and Shell (RDS.A) (RDS.B) are a part of the index, which consists of large UK companies. BP, RDS.A, and RDS.B have a ~15% weight in the index in terms of market capitalization. To learn about which integrated energy stocks have higher institutional holdings, continue to the next part.
