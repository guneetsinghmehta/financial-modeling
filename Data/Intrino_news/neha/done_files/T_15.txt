<p>In the telecommunications world, 5G (fifth-generation) technology is generating a lot of hype, as it could provide ten to 100 times faster wireless speeds than 4G (fourth-generation) technology. <strong>Verizon</strong>&rsquo;s ( VZ ) progress in the 5G space continues. The company believes that it will be the first major US carrier to deploy 5G technology on its network, although that probably won&rsquo;t happen until the end of 2017&mdash;and only as a fixed wireless broadband solution. 5G services need connections to fiber-optic networks in dense urban areas. If <strong>Verizon</strong> does propose to acquire <strong>Charter Communications</strong> ( CHTR ), it could be interested in its fiber and coaxial cable infrastructure for 5G technology. Through a <strong>Charter</strong> acquisition, <strong>Verizon</strong> would gain a dense fixed fiber network in several major metropolitan areas, including a backhaul network that would help the company&rsquo;s 5G efforts. Early in 2016, <strong>Verizon</strong> acquired<strong> XO Communications</strong> for $1.8 billion. <strong>XO</strong> will provide <strong>Verizon</strong> with fiber-optic networks in 40 major US markets. The pending acquisition will help support <strong>Verizon</strong>&rsquo;s services for enterprise and wholesale customers and enable it to continue to densify its wireless cell network to both enhance 4G LTE (long-term evolution) coverage and provide the basics for an eventual 5G wireless rollout. <strong>AT T</strong> (T) has also been an aggressive player in the 5G market. Even in the past, it&rsquo;s tried to outbid its rivals in order to gain spectrum advantage. <strong>AT T</strong> was the highest bidder during the AWS-3 spectrum auctions in early 2015,&nbsp;purchasing spectrum worth $18.2 billion. The AWS-3 spectrum auction was the major auction conducted by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) after 2008. As seen in the graph above,<strong> Verizon</strong> and <strong>T-Mobile</strong> ( TMUS ) also participated in the auction and made winning bids of $10.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. <strong>Verizon</strong> is working on its 5G initiative with <strong>Cisco</strong> ( CSCO ), <strong>Nokia</strong> ( NOK ),<strong> Ericsson</strong> ( ERIC ), <strong>Intel</strong> ( INTC ), and <strong>Samsung</strong> ( SSNLF ).
