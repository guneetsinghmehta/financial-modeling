<strong>Hejun Vanguard Group</strong> filed two complaints with MOFCOM * Company says <strong>McDonald</strong>'s franchise deal will pressure costs * <strong>McDonald</strong>'s says it has filed deal for MOFCOM review By Michelle Price and Julie Zhu HONG KONG, Feb 16 (Reuters) - A Chinese consultancy that has previously helped to win antitrust battles against <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> has taken aim at <strong>McDonald's Corp</strong> , arguing in a complaint to regulators that the American fast food giant's China sale may hurt workers and consumers. <strong>McDonald</strong>'s said last month it had agreed to sell the bulk of its China and Hong Kong business to state-backed conglomerate <strong>CITIC Ltd</strong> and U.S. private equity firm <strong>Carlyle Group LP</strong> for up to $2.1 billion, in a deal that will see the consortium act as the master franchisee for a 20-year period. The complaint, which follows allegations from a U.S. labour union that the transaction will likely lead to poorer pay and conditions for <strong>McDonald</strong>'s 120,000 workers in China, could delay regulatory approval for the deal. Beijing-based <strong>Hejun Vanguard Group</strong>, a Chinese management consultancy that has a track-record of representing domestic companies against foreign firms, filed two separate complaints against <strong>McDonald</strong>'s with the Ministry of Commerce's (MOFCOM) antimonopoly bureau and its franchise office, <strong>Hejun Vanguard</strong> told <strong>Reuters</strong>. MOFCOM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "The deal will put enormous downward pressure on <strong>McDonald</strong>'s master franchisees, existing franchisees that operate individual stores, and the workers and customers of those stores," said Li Su, CEO of <strong>Hejun Vanguard Group</strong> in a statement. "Regulators should investigate the transaction and impose restrictions to prevent <strong>McDonald</strong>'s from abusing its dominant market position." <strong>CITIC and CITIC Capital</strong>, an affiliate company that manages private equity funds, will hold 52 percent following the deal. <strong>Carlyle</strong> will control 28 percent of the business, while <strong>McDonald</strong>'s will retain a 20 percent stake. <strong>McDonald</strong>'s currently owns and operates most of its outlets on the mainland but the deal will see the fast-foot giant move to a franchise model that should allow it to continue to profit from sales while cutting costs.
