<p>Among all major U.S. banks, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>' business model relies the most on trading revenues, with its fixed income, currencies, commodities (FICC) and equity trading desks together roping in more than 47% of its total revenues for 2016. The proportion is a much lower 16% for <strong>Bank of America</strong>, which - like peers <strong>Citigroup</strong> and <strong>JPMorgan</strong> - has a considerably diversified business model. Notably, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> is the only bank in this list which has left its overall business model relatively unchanged since the start of this century, with more than 80% of its revenues coming from securities trading, advisory and underwriting, and principal investing. Morgan Stanley stepped away from volatile trading industry by shrinking its FICC trading desk and focusing on its wealth management capabilities after the acquisition of Smith Barney from <strong>Citigroup</strong>. While <strong>Citigroup</strong> had to contend with smaller trading operations in the wake of heavy losses during the economic downturn, <strong>JPMorgan</strong> and <strong>Bank of America</strong> emerged from the downturn with a larger presence in the industry thanks to their acquisitions of <strong>Bear Stearns</strong> and <strong>Merrill Lynch</strong> respectively. With <strong>Goldman</strong> betting on steady growth in the global FICC trading industry, and with stricter regulations reining in its principal investment business over the years, we believe that securities trading could end up contributing more than 50% of the premier investment bank's top line in the near future.
