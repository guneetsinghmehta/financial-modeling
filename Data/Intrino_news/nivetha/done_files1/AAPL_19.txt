Last month, <strong>Amazon</strong> ( AMZN ) and <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ) decided to end an exclusive contract for the supply and distribution of audiobooks. In 2008, the companies entered a global agreement in which <strong>Amazon</strong>s audiobook supplier Audible could only supply to <strong>Apple</strong>. However, the arrangement was widely criticized in Europe, where regulators claimed it wasnt fair. According to the Association of American Publishers, the US market for downloaded audiobooks was worth $552 million in 2015, up from $299 million in 2012. Publishers in Germany were the first to complain about the Amazon-Apple audiobook exclusivity deal. According to the publishers, the arrangement gave the companies an unfair advantage in the audiobook market, as 90% or more of audiobook downloads in the country were through either <strong>Amazon</strong> or Audible sites, or <strong>Apple</strong>s platform. The end of the exclusive contract means Audible has been freed to supply customers outside <strong>Apple</strong> with audiobooks. <strong>Apple</strong> is also free to source audiobooks from other suppliers. Regulators in Europe welcomed the development and announced an end to their probe into the controversial audiobook exclusivity arrangement. The scrapping of the exclusivity deal could lead to the audiobook industry growing more quickly, potentially yielding more sales for <strong>Amazon</strong> despite book prices falling because of higher competition. Additionally, ending the exclusivity saves <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> from potential fines they could have faced in Europe if the investigation into their deal was found to violate the regions antitrust laws. The market for digital content, from audiobooks to videos , is heating up, with companies such as <strong>AT T</strong> (T), <strong>Alphabet</strong> ( GOOGL ), <strong>Sony</strong> ( SNE ), and <strong>Netflix</strong> ( NFLX ) fighting to dominate the market.
