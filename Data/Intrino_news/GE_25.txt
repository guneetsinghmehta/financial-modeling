Swedish industrial metals 3D-printing specialist Arcam AB ( NASDAQOTH:AMAVF ) reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results last week. Quarterly revenue grew 18.2% to 208.1 million Swedish krona, or approximately $22.9 million. However, operating income, net income, and earnings per share turned negative.  Arcam's results were better than the headline numbers reflect. The company incurred nonrecurring costs of 44.8 million Swedish krona in the quarter, which were fully responsible for turning operating income negative. Moreover, it faced tough comparables, as it had a strong year in 2015.  Shares of Arcam have soared 117% in the one-year period through Feb. 13. The bulk of this gain came in September after General Electric ( NYSE:GE ) announced its intention to acquire Arcam. While the industrial giant came up short on the complete takeover, it owns 76.1% of Arcam's shares, giving it a controlling stake.  Metric Q4 2016 Q4 2015 Change (YOY) Revenue 208.1 million SEK 176.0 million SEK 18.2% Operating income (29.1 million SEK) 14.0 million SEK N/A Net income (17.5 million SEK) 2.7 million SEK N/A Earnings per share Data source: Arcam.

These costs carry through to negatively impact net income and earnings per share (EPS). Of the total revenue, 128.7 million SEK -- or nearly 62% -- was generated from the parent company, down from 139.7 million SEK in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The remaining revenue was generated by the company's two subsidiaries: Connecticut-based orthopedic implant contract manufacturer DiSanto and Canada-based metal powder producer AP C.

Of the total revenue, 403.4 million SEK -- or just over 62% -- was generated from the parent company, down from 423.5 million SEK in 2015. DiSanto and AP C contributed the remainder.  Image source: Arcam. Given General Electric's deep pockets and influence in the industrial realm, its acquisition of a controlling stake in Arcam should provide a tailwind for Arcam's growth going forward. However, the bidding process had a negative impact on Arcam's operations in the second half of 2016, since it consumed top management time, according to CEO Magnus Rene's statement in the press release. Moreover, Rene noted that EBM customers have been taking a "somewhat cautious position," and that Arcam is finding that "it takes longer to close new orders." Arcam's year-over-year revenue jumped 18.2% in the quarter and 12.5% in 2016. This is good growth for a pure-play 3D printing company in the current environment, which continues to be characterized by a slowdown in demand for 3D printers by industrial customers and a lengthening of sales cycles.  Moreover, Arcam's operating income for both the quarter and year were positive, excluding the nonrecurring expenses incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these expenses, year-over-year operating income increased in the quarter. Importantly, demand for Arcam's EBM systems remains solid. Granted, investors would prefer an increase, but the absence of a decrease in the current environment is a positive.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.
