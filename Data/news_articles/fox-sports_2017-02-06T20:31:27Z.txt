Heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic will look to avenge the last loss he suffered when he faces Junior Dos Santos in a main event rematch at UFC 211 in Dallas on May 13. Sources close to the contest confirmed the news to FOX Sports on Monday following an initial report from Combate in Brazil. UFC officials have not made any announcement regarding the matchup yet. The title fight has been rumored for a couple of weeks after Dos Santos was pulled from his last fight in Halifax when opponent Stefan Struve was forced off the card and the UFC was unable to secure a replacement. Now Dos Santos will look to get the heavyweight title back around his waist after losing the belt to Cain Velasquez in 2012. Most recently, Dos Santos dispatched Ben Rothwell in a five round decision last April as the Brazilian has bounced back and forth between wins and losses over his past six fights. Meanwhile, Miocic will be defending his title for the second time after defeating Alistair Overeem in his hometown of Cleveland at UFC 203. Miocic won the belt with a stunning first round knockout over Fabricio Werdum last May and now looks to avenge one of only two losses he s suffered in the UFC. Dos Santos defeated Miocic in a five round war in 2014 in arguably one of the best heavyweight fights in recent memory. No other fights have been confirmed for UFC 211, but the event will be hosted at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. 16 Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC | Zuffa LLC via Getty Images
