In this part of the series, we’ll look at some value-centric metrics for Verizon ( VZ ) compared to its peers in the US wireless space. Let’s start with the sizes of the top four US wireless carriers: Verizon, AT T (T), T-Mobile ( TMUS ), and Sprint (S). On February 13, 2017, AT T was the largest US telecommunications player by market capitalization, Verizon was the second-largest, and T-Mobile was the third-largest. Sprint’s market capitalization remained lower than T-Mobile’s. Price-based valuation multiples take into account value from a shareholder’s perspective. EV-based (enterprise value) multiples help investors to understand the value of a company via its sources of capital from a shareholder’s point of view. They’re forward multiples based on stocks’ expected values after a year. Let’s look at the earnings multiples of Verizon and its peers. On February 13, 2017, Verizon was trading at a forward PE (price-to-earnings) multiple of ~12.18x, lower than AT T’s ~13.38x. On the same day, Verizon’s forward EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) multiple was ~6.60x, higher than Sprint’s ~6.08x. Meanwhile, AT T and T-Mobile had forward EV-to-EBITDAs of ~6.70x and ~6.87x, respectively. In the next article, we’ll look at analysts’ recommendations for Charter Communications ( CHTR ) stock.
