But this growth has not come as a result of improvement in gross margins or any cost control activities in its operations. Gross margins went from 23.21% to 25.06% for the same period last year, while operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 14.31% to 15.98% over the same time frame. Quadrant label definitions.

Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet. IP-US s decline in gross margins has not produced any significant offsetting improvement in its working capital . This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the decline in gross margins are likely from operating issues and not trade-offs with the balance sheet. Working capital days are currently 63.07 days, compared to last year s level of 48.15 days. Quadrant label definitions.

IP-US s change in operating cash flow of -7.88% compared to the same period last year is about the same as its change in earnings this period. Additionally, this change in operating cash flow is about average among its peer group. This suggests that the company did not use accruals or reserves to manage earnings this period, and that, all else being equal, the earnings number is sustainable. Quadrant label definitions.
