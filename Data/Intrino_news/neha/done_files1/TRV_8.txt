The financial sector seems a clear winner of Trump presidency and Fed policy. The stocks in the sector are enjoying a surge since the election on the heels of Trumps promise to deregulate the industry and lower corporate taxes. Additionally, rising interest rates, stabilizing oil prices and strong corporate earnings are backing the rally. Total earnings for 79.9% of the sectors total market capitalization that have reported so far are up 11.8% on 5% higher revenues with beat ratios of 66.2% and 60.8%, respectively. The growth rates for the same group of companies are better than the 12-quarter average of 5.6% for earnings and 1.9% for revenue (read: Will Trump Fed Make 2017 a Year of Financials ETFs?).
