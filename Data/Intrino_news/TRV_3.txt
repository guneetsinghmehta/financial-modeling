income are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net
income and segment operating income are presented on a pre-tax basis, unless
otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a
diluted basis. Overview Diluted net income per share of $10.28 in 2016 decreased by 6% from diluted
net income per share of $10.88 in 2015. Net income of $3.01 billion in 2016
decreased by 12% from net income of $3.44 billion in 2015. The lower rate of
decrease in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share
repurchases in recent periods. The decrease in net income primarily reflected
the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower underwriting
margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development
( underlying underwriting margins ), (iii) lower net favorable prior year
reserve development and (iv) lower net investment income, partially offset by (v) higher other revenues and (vi) higher net realized investment gains.
Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 were $877 million and $514 million,
respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 was
$771 million and $941 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting
margins Table of Contents primarily resulted from (i) higher loss estimates in the personal automobile
product line for bodily injury liability coverages, (ii) the impact of loss cost
trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business and International
Insurance and (iii) higher general and administrative expenses. Partially
offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in income was a related decrease in income
tax expense. Diluted net income per share of $10.88 in 2015 increased by 2% over diluted
net income per share of $10.70 in 2014. Net income of $3.44 billion in 2015
decreased by 7% from net income of $3.69 billion in 2014. The percentage
increase in diluted net income per share compared with the percentage decrease
in net income reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The
decrease in net income primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower net
investment income, (ii) lower net realized investment gains, (iii) a decline in
other revenues and (iv) slightly lower underlying underwriting margins,
partially offset by (v) lower catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses in 2015 and
2014 were $514 million and $709 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year
reserve development in both 2015 and 2014 was $941 million. Partially offsetting
this net pre-tax decrease in income was a related decrease in income tax
expense. In addition, income tax expense in 2015 was reduced by $32 million as a
result of the resolution of prior year tax matters. The Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and the
Republic of Ireland, as well as in Brazil, primarily through a joint venture.
Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S.
dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, changes in foreign
currency exchange rates had the impact of lowering the reported line items in
the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The impact of these changes
was not material to the Company's net income or Business and International
Insurance's operating income for the years reported. Revenues Earned Premiums Earned premiums in 2016 were $24.53 billion, $660 million or 3% higher than
in 2015. In Business and International Insurance, earned premiums in 2016
increased by 1% over 2015. In Bond Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in
2016 were comparable to 2015. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2016
increased by 8% over 2015. Earned premiums in 2015 were $23.87 billion,
$161 million or 1% higher than in 2014. In each of Business and International
Insurance and Bond Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in 2015 were
comparable to 2014. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2015 increased by
2% over 2014. Factors contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each segment in
2016 and 2015 compared with the respective prior year are discussed in more
detail in the segment discussions that follow. Net Investment Income The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's
investments. (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Average investments(1) $ 70,246 $ 70,627 $ 72,049 Pre-tax net investment income 2,302 2,379 2,787 After-tax net investment income 1,846 1,905 2,216 Average pre-tax yield(2) 3.3 % 3.4 % 3.9 % Average after-tax yield(2) 2.6 % 2.7 % 3.1 %

receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and
accrued investment income. º (2) º Excludes net realized and net unrealized investment gains and losses. Table of Contents Net investment income in 2016 was $2.30 billion, $77 million or 3% lower
than in 2015. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2016 was
$1.98 billion, $110 million lower than in 2015. The decrease primarily resulted
from lower long-term reinvestment rates available in the market and a modestly
lower amount of fixed income investments that were impacted by the Company's
$524 million payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc.
litigation in the second quarter of 2016. Net investment income from short-term
securities in 2016 was $29 million, $17 million higher than in 2015, primarily
due to higher short-term interest rates. Net investment income generated by
non-fixed maturity investments in 2016 was $330 million, $13 million higher than
in 2015, primarily due to higher returns from private equity limited
partnerships, partially offset by lower returns from real estate partnerships. Net investment income in 2015 was $2.38 billion, $408 million or 15% lower
than in 2014. Investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2015 was
$2.09 billion, $153 million lower than in 2014. The decrease primarily resulted
from lower long-term reinvestment rates available in the market and a modestly
lower amount of fixed income investments that were impacted by the Company's
$579 million payment in the first quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of
the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation. Investment income generated by non-fixed
maturity investments in 2015 was $317 million, $256 million lower than in 2014
primarily due to lower returns from private equity limited partnerships and
hedge fund investments. Returns from private equity limited partnerships in 2015
were impacted by lower valuations for energy-related investments. Fee Income The National Accounts market in Business and International Insurance is the
primary source of the Company's fee-based business. Fee income is described in
more detail in Business and International Insurance discussion that follows. Net Realized Investment Gains The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's net
pre-tax realized investment gains. (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Net Realized Investment Gains Other-than-temporary impairment losses $ (29 ) $ (52 ) $ (26 ) Other net realized investment gains 97 55 105 Net realized investment gains $ 68 $ 3 $ 79 Other Net Realized Investment Gains Other net realized investment gains in 2016 included $59 million of net
realized gains related to fixed maturity investments, $14 million of net
realized investment gains related to equity securities, $7 million of net
realized investment gains from real estate sales and $17 million of net realized
investment gains related to other investments. Other net realized investment gains in 2015 included $81 million of net
realized gains related to fixed maturity investments, $6 million of net realized
investment gains related to equity securities, $2 million of net realized
investment gains from real estate sales and $34 million of net realized
investment losses related to other investments. The net realized investment
losses related to other investments included $26 million of realized foreign
exchange translation losses incurred in connection with the Company's increased
ownership of Travelers Participações em Seguros Brasil S.A. Table of Contents Other net realized investment gains in 2014 included $35 million of net
realized gains resulting from the sale of substantially all of one of the
Company's real estate joint venture investments. The remaining $70 million of
other net realized gains in 2014 were primarily driven by $32 million of net
realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $24 million of
net realized investment gains related to equity securities, $8 million of net
realized investment gains related to other investments and $6 million of net
realized investment gains from other real estate sales. Other Revenues Other revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges.
Other revenues in 2016 also included a $126 million gain related to the
favorable settlement of a reinsurance dispute (discussed in more detail in
note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements), as well as proceeds
from the favorable settlement of a claims-related legal matter. Other revenues
in 2014 also included revenues associated with the runoff of the Company's
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) business that was sold on a renewal
rights basis in 2013. Claims and Expenses Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were $15.07 billion,
$1.35 billion or 10% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher volumes of insured exposures, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher
catastrophe losses, (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (v) higher loss estimates in the personal automobile product line for bodily
injury liability coverages, partially offset by (vi) lower levels of what the
Company defines as large losses. Catastrophe losses in 2016 included losses from
Hurricane Matthew, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States,
flooding in the Southeast region of the United States, wildfires in Canada and
Tennessee, and winter storms in the eastern United States. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2015 were $13.72 billion,
$147 million or 1% lower than in 2014, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) lower catastrophe losses and (ii) lower non-catastrophe weather-related
losses, partially offset by (iii) loss cost trends. Catastrophe losses in 2015
included wildfires in California, hail and wind storms in several regions of the
United States and winter storms in several regions of the United States.
Catastrophe losses in 2014 included multiple wind and hail storms in several
regions of the United States and a winter storm in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern
and Southeastern regions of the United States. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development in each
segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are discussed in
more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. Significant Catastrophe Losses The Company defines a catastrophe as an event that: º • º is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized
organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from
catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events
in the United States and Canada; and º • º the Company's estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and
taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold. The Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is determined at the
reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination
thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event,
losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment
results and for the consolidated results of the Company. The threshold for 2016
ranged from approximately $17 million to $30 million of losses before
reinsurance and taxes. Table of Contents The following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company
for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2016, 2015 and 2014, the amount of
related net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in
subsequent years, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. For purposes of the table, a significant
catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will
be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes. Losses Incurred / Unfavorable (Favorable) Prior Year Reserve Development for the Year Estimated Ultimate Ended December 31, Losses at December 31,

reserve development in 2015 and 2014 provided 3.9 points of benefit to the loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio in each year. The underlying loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio in 2015 was 0.1 points lower than the 2014 ratio on the
same basis. The underwriting expense ratio of 31.7% in 2015 was 0.3 points higher than

operating income of $2.17 billion in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax
impacts of (i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower underlying underwriting
margins and (iii) lower net investment income, partially offset by (iv) higher
other revenues and (v) higher net favorable prior year reserve development.
Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 were $512 million and $247 million,
respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 was
$484 million and $405 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting
margins primarily resulted from (i) the impact of loss cost trends that modestly
exceeded earned pricing and (ii) higher general and administrative expenses,
partially offset by (iii) lower levels of what the Company defines as large
losses. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in operating income was a
related decrease in income tax expense. Operating income in 2015 was $2.17 billion, $177 million or 8% lower than
operating income of $2.35 billion in 2014, primarily reflecting the pre-tax
impacts of (i) lower net investment income and (ii) lower underlying
