Earlier, we discussed how Sanovi Technologies could enhance IBM’s position in the hybrid cloud space. Let’s see how Sanovi would complement IBM’s “disaster recovery strategy.” We know that Sanovi Technologies would be integrated into IBM’s Resiliency Services, including DRaaS (disaster recovery as a service) and BaaS (backup-as-a-service). In June 2016, IBM was positioned as a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for DRaaS for the second straight year. Gartner expects that from 2016 to 2020, the use of either IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) or DRaaS “to support the failover of production applications will grow by more than 200%.” Through its acquisition of Sanovi Technologies, IBM intends to expand its Disaster Recovery Services to its Hybrid Cloud offerings. Martin Jetter, senior vice president of IBM’s Global Technology Services, stated, “As a cloud-native company, Sanovi will strengthen our resiliency portfolio to manage the broad range of applications, data, and IT systems of our clients balancing digital and hybrid cloud transformation with increased regulatory compliance.” Let’s see why we expect significant growth in the disaster, backup, and recovery space. Salesforce.com ( CRM ) estimates that over 90% of the world’s data have been generated in the last two years. The number of connected devices is projected to reach 75 billion by 2020. If we consider EMC ( EMC ) estimates, by 2020, the digital universe will grow 300 times, from the present 130 exabytes to 40,000 exabytes. With such an explosion in data, the need for a backup and disaster recovery process can’t be ruled out. This explains technology players IBM’s and Microsoft’s ( MSFT ) billion dollar investments and strategic focuses on the machine-learning space. Quote data by Xignite
