While Alphabet ( GOOGL ) may seem to be on a diet given its recent moves such as shutting down its Titan drone Internet program and whittling down its workforce at Google Fiber, the tech giant continues to show an appetite for bolt-on acquisitions. In a recent development, Google, the most profitable Alphabet branch, said it was acquiring a little-known unit of Twitter ( TWTR ) called Fabric. While Fabric may not ring many bells, it is a tool for developing mobile apps and has been around since 2014. Fabric is used by more than 580,000 developers, according to the Wall Street Journal . Smartphone app usage is on the rise, and this trend is helping drive services revenue for companies such as Google and Apple ( AAPL ). Mobile app researcher App Annie released findings that showed that app downloads increased 15% in 2016, with developers receiving $89 billion in app revenues. This figure is set to rise to $189 billion by 2020. App distribution platform operators keep 30% of app revenues while developers take 70%. Twitter’s Fabric previously competed with Google’s Firebase. Following the acquisition, Fabric and Firebase teams would work together. For Google, the acquisition now puts two of the most widely used mobile app tools under the company’s control. Because Fabric is popular among developers for Apple’s iOS platform, Google can now encourage those developers to create Android versions of their iOS apps, making the Android ecosystem richer in content and apps. Additionally, Fabric could help increase sales at Google’s Cloud division. Firebase users buy cloud storage and other cloud services from Google. The more than 580,000 developers coming through Fabric increase the pool of developers that Google can target with its cloud products. Google is locked in fierce competition with Amazon ( AMZN ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Oracle ( ORCL ), and IBM ( IBM ) for control of the cloud computing market. Quote data by Xignite
