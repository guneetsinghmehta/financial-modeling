[Updates with estimated AppDynamics revenue.] Shares of networking giant Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) are up 5 cents at $30.65, in late trading, after the company this evening said it will spend $3.7 billon in cash and stock to acquire privately held AppDynamics  of San Francisco, which specializes in measuring how software programs perform. AppDynamics, founded in 2008, which was bankrolled by  Kleiner Perkins  and  Greylock , had raised over $200 million as of the last time I spoke with them, in late 2014. The company at that time was on a “run rate” of $120 million, but I have no idea what the number would be now. AppDynamics, is in a field known as “application performance management,” or “APM,” or sometimes called “ application intelligence .” It’s used for things such as measuring how responsive a cloud computing app is for each user. The closes comparable in the public market would be  New Relic  ( NEWR ), or divisions of larger companies, such as  CA  ( CA ) or  IBM  ( IBM ). New Relic shares are up 20 cents, or 0.6%, at $33.50, in late trading, Cisco said the company’s CEO , David Wadhwani , will continue to run the operation. Cisco’s head of its Internet of Things and applications efforts, Rowan Trollope , remarked of the deal: The combination of Cisco and AppDynamics will allow us to provide end to end visibility and intelligence from the network through to the application; which, combined with security and scale, and help IT to drive a new level of business results. Update :  RBC Capital s  Mitch Steves tonight weighs in, reiterating an Outperform rating on Cisco stock and a $35 price tag. The deal is somewhat pricey, he writes, but may be worth it: AppDynamics filed to go public and according to the S-1 filing, the Company was generating ~$60.3M in quarterly revenue as of the Oct-qtr (+54% y/y). Overall, the Company had LTM revenue of $206M (~18x LTM sales) and assuming 50% growth (similar to last quarter) this would represent $309M (~12x NTM sales). While the transaction value appears to be high, with high-end software transactions occurring at ~9x NTM sales, we view more software related revenue as a long-term positive. Finally, given that the Company is operating at a loss, we think the transaction will be dilutive on a near-term basis. Net Net: while the transaction value appears to be on the high side, we remain positive on shares of Cisco given its continued move towards software security related revenue. Error message Why not wait for the public offering buy all the shares fro 150 millon. $3.7B for a Monitoring System using Cssandra (open source DB ) with some usual UI effects? Even 150 million is too much as Paul Rinderie commented. This will end up like another WebEx, Scientific Atlanta. I wish i could toss my drinking buds 4B of someone else's $$$.
