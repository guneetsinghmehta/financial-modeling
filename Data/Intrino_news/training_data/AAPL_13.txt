<strong>Nokia</strong> ( NOK ) seems to have returned to the handset business with a splash. The companys first handset after a nearly two-year lull, the Nokia 6, sold out within a minute during its first flash sale in China. The handset was exclusively offered in China. The company didnt say how many units were sold in the first flash sale, but it plans to hold more such sales. China has demonstrated great interest in the Nokia 6 at a time when consumer interest in <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ) iPhones seems to be waning. <strong>Apple</strong> said its sales in Greater China decreased 12% year-over-year to $16.2 billion in fiscal 1Q17. The companys worldwide sales totaled $78.4 billion. <strong>Apple</strong> is betting on a revolutionary iPhone model this year to jumpstart sales. If Nokias smartphone brands prove widely popular among Chinese consumers, its return to growth may be delayed or the company may not recover its footing in the market. The Nokia 6 handset, which features 4GB RAM and a 5.5-inch display, costs ~$245, compared to <strong>Apple</strong>s iPhone, which costs more than $600. Competitive pricing has already given Chinese brands <strong>Huawei</strong> and <strong>Xiaomi</strong> an edge against Apple and <strong>Samsung</strong> ( SSNLF ) in China and several other emerging markets. Nokia is planning to release more smartphone models this year, including the Nokia P1, which it plans to unveil at the MWC 2017 event. Nokia P1 is expected to be a premium handset costing $800 for a model that offers 128 GB in storage and ~$950 for the 256 GB version. Nokias return to the phone business comes two years after it exited the scene following the sale of its Devices unit to <strong>Microsoft</strong> ( MSFT ). However, the return of Nokia is not likely to rattle <strong>Apple</strong> or also other smartphone vendors such as <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Alphabet</strong> ( GOOGL ), and <strong>BlackBerry</strong> ( BBRY ).
