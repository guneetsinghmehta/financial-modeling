Published: Feb 16, 2017 1:56 p.m. ET <strong>J.P. Morgan</strong> analyst warns repatriation optimism may be premature given tax reform difficulties By <strong>Ciscos</strong> core business continues to struggle, but analysts say its too early to give up on the stock even as the company works through a lengthy transition thats included five straight quarters of shrinking revenue. Shares CSCO, +0.35%  traded higher Thursday, up some 3% to $33.71, after analysts issued cautiously optimistic notes to clients following the companys slightly better-than-expected earnings out Wednesday . The notes largely assured investors that <strong>Cisco</strong> remains on track, despite major declines in its core switching and router businesses. While there were no major ratings changes on the stock through Thursday morningthe average rating is the equivalent to buya number of Wall Street analysts did marginally increase their price targets, many by just a dollar or two. Among those increases were Raymond James, to $34 from $33; <strong>J.P. Morgan</strong>, to $33 from $29; RBC, to $37 from $35; and <strong>Wunderlich Securities</strong>, to $30 from $27. The tone in their notes to clients can best be described as cautiously optimistic, with many expressing disappointment in Ciscos sales outlook for the current quarter and declines in some of Ciscos core businesses offset by optimism for the companys cloud business and efforts to boost recurring revenues through subscriptions.

We maintain our outperform rating on <strong>Cisco</strong>, with ongoing challenges leading sales estimates lower but cost control and stable margin aiding EPS, wrote <strong>Raymond James</strong> analyst Simon Leopold. Wunderlich analysts kept their hold rating on the stock and said they were boosting their price target slightly to reflect prospects for more long-term growth. <strong>J.P. Morgan</strong> analyst Rod Hall, who reiterated a neutral rating, said he slightly increased his price target to reflect slightly better-than-expected earnings, but cautioned that the recent stock run up has been largely due to the belief that President Donald Trump will overhaul tax rules . Trump, although he has not offered specific policy details but pledges a massive tax plan , is expected to make it more affordable for companies to return international profits back to the U.S. to reinvest in share buybacks, dividends, R D and M A. However, Hall says thats premature given the complexity of getting a tax deal done in Washington.

RBCs Mitch Steves said <strong>Cisco</strong> is making the correct structural changes to move to a recurring-revenue model, while <strong>Pacific Crests</strong> Alex Kurtz said that after a challenging first quarter, <strong>Cisco</strong> in its most recent quarter displayed stability in the sector. Late Wednesday, <strong>Cisco</strong> reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents a share on sales of $11.58 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus estimate of 56 cents on sales of $11.55 billion. The company also announced plans to boost its quarterly dividend to 29 cents from 26 cents. Among the decliners in <strong>Ciscos</strong> earnings report were switching and routing, which recorded revenue decreases of 5% and 10%, respectively. That was partially offset by a 14% increase in security revenue, though that business still comprises a small portion of <strong>Cisco</strong> overall. Cis<strong>c</strong>o shares increased nearly 7% in the past three months and 31% in the past year, virtually in line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.27% , a 30-component index of which <strong>Cisco</strong> is a member.
