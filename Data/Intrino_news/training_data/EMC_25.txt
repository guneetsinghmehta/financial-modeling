<strong>Symantec</strong> ( SYMC ) leads the security software space, followed by <strong>Intel</strong> ( INTC ). However, in 2015, its revenue reported the highest fall over a three-year period. Despite facing its third straight year of revenue falls, <strong>Symantec</strong> continued to be the top player in the security software space. The consumer security segment, within the global security software space, recorded the steepest fall of 4.9% YoY (year-over-year). Gartner reported that global security software revenue rose 3.7% to $22.1 billion in 2015. <strong>Symantecs</strong> fall was expected. Because it was a leader in the space, it was bound to face the maximum impact of the fall in the overall consumer security space. Consumer endpoint protection platforms, including DLP (data loss prevention), contributed 74% toward <strong>Symantecs</strong> overall revenue. Together, they fell 7% YoY and were a significant contributor to companys revenue fall in 2015. The steep fall in consumer security software indicates the ever increasing sophistication of security breaches. Thus, businesses are keen to make investments in analytics-based security approaches such as SIEM (security information and event management), as it could lead to significant future savings. Sometimes, the cost incurred to deal with a single security breach can run into the millions of dollars. As expected, SIEM technology, which supports threat detection and provides a response to security breaches, grew the fastest in the security software space in 2015. It reported 15.8% growth. As you can see from the chart above, <strong>IBM</strong> ( <strong>IBM</strong> ) was the only player among the top five players<strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>Symantec</strong>, <strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Trend Micro</strong>, and <strong>EMC</strong> ( <strong>EMC</strong> )to report revenue growth. This growth was on the back of SIEM revenue, coupled with its service business, which enabled it to report revenue growth. <strong>IBMs</strong> SIEM platform, based on the QRadar Security Intelligence Platform , got another boost from its Resilient Systems acquisition in 2015. Resilient Systems is known for its incident response platform. In its recently announced fiscal 3Q16 results , <strong>IBM</strong> stated that its Mobile and Security revenue rose 19.0% and 11.0%, respectively, to $1.2 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively.
