Now we’ll take a closer look at AT T (T), which has been investing heavily in capex to improve its network and buy additional spectrum for future use. AT T spent $6.5 billion on capex in 4Q16 and just under $23.0 billion in 2016. AT T is focusing on a SDN (software-defined networking) approach to transform its network. SDN helps telecom companies save costs and provide more flexibility, as this approach requires them to virtualize their networks instead of spending on dedicated fixed hardware. The proposed acquisition of Time Warner ( TWX ) will help AT T to lower its capex investments with minimal capex requirements at Time Warner balancing AT T’s higher capex needs. As a result, AT T will have more resources and opportunities to invest in 5G technology. AT T expects the acquisition to be accretive on a free cash flow growth (or FCF) per share basis in the first year after the close of the acquisition. Also, AT T has deleveraging potential within the first year of closing the deal given the attractive FCF of the combined companies. AT T is expected to spend approximately $22 billion on capex in 2017. In comparison, competitor Verizon ( VZ ) expects capex to be in the range of $16.8 billion–$17.5 billion for 2017, whereas Sprint (S) is expected to spend approximately $2.3 billion on capex in fiscal 2017. Meanwhile, T-Mobile ( TMUS ) will report its results for 4Q16 on February 14, 2017. AT T and Verizon generated $39.3 billion and $22.7 billion, respectively, in operating cash flow in 2016, which gave them leeway to direct more toward capex. Quote data by Xignite
