<p>Published: Feb 15, 2017 7:01 a.m. ET Companies agree to pay $335.4 million each to settle personal injury lawsuits relating to exposure to a toxic chemical By Shares of chemical company <strong>Chemours Co.</strong> surged to a fresh record close Monday, after the company and former parent <strong>E.I. DuPont de Nemours Cie.</strong> agreed to pay $335.4 million each to settle personal injury lawsuits relating to exposure to a toxic chemical at a West Virginia plant. Shares ended up 14.2% for their biggest one-day gain in seven months. Don&rsquo;t miss: 2 chemical stocks to buy and 2 to sell <strong>DuPont</strong> DD, -0.39% &nbsp;and <strong>Chemours</strong> CC, +4.36% which was spun off in July 2015, have been the subject of more than 3,000 lawsuits in federal and state courts in Ohio and West Virginia over exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid in drinking water. The chemical, known as PFOA, was used for many years as a plastic coating and to make products such as Teflon nonstick cooking utensils. Attorneys for the companies and the plaintiffs in the multidistrict litigation agreed to the settlement. The companies both deny wrongdoing and stopped making the chemicals more than 10 years ago. &ldquo;The agreement resolves all indemnification obligations between <strong>Chemours</strong> and <strong>DuPont</strong> for all of the approximately 3,500 claims in the Ohio multidistrict litigation,&rdquo; <strong>Chemours</strong> said in a statement.

However, with <strong>DuPont</strong> paying half, the net-liability for <strong>Chemours</strong> is within the bounds of the research firm&rsquo;s expectations. Lawsuits on health and environmental liability are among the biggest risks affecting the chemical industry. But could they also be one of the main drivers of progress? &ldquo;Given <strong>DuPont&rsquo;s</strong> merger with <strong>Dow</strong> and the amount of value at stake for Dow/DuPont, it is not overly surprising that DuPont would step up its contribution level to achieve certainty in this matter,&rdquo; CreditSight analysts wrote in a comment. &ldquo;For <strong>Chemours</strong>, the settlement is manageable and significantly less than many investors were modeling in.&rdquo; <strong>DuPont</strong> is currently in the midst of a merger with <strong>Dow Chemical Co.</strong> DOW, -0.28% &nbsp; <strong>Chemours</strong> bonds also rallied on the news as the litigation cloud lifted. CreditSights said it is moving to an outperform rating from underperform on the news.
