<p><strong>Alphabet</strong>&rsquo;s ( GOOGL ) aggressive revenue diversification push could be creating risks for the company. Its in-house ad-buying practice has recently come under scrutiny by the media, raising questions of potential conflicts of interest that could turn off many brand advertisers and could cost the company its lifeline&mdash;advertising revenue. <strong>Alphabe</strong>t said ads funded 87% of its total revenues in 4Q16. The company reported revenues of $26.1 billion for the quarter, a 22% increase. The company also made progress on its nonadvertising business, as revenues in the segment increased 62% to $3.4 billion. <strong>Alphabet</strong>&rsquo;s nonadvertising revenues come from sources such as the sale of handsets and cloud computing services. The company also uses its <strong>Google</strong> search engine to promote its products. According to research findings by SEMrush published in&nbsp;the Wall Street Journal , ads of <strong>Alphabet</strong>&rsquo;s brand products dominated the most prominent ad spots in <strong>Google</strong> search results at some points last year. The findings have reignited the debate about the fairness of <strong>Google</strong>&rsquo;s ad pricing and placement. For instance, <strong>Google</strong> ads were found to make up more than 70% of CRM (customer relationship management) searches. Although <strong>Google</strong> itself doesn&rsquo;t sell CRM products, its <strong>Google</strong> Cloud platform can be used to run CRM applications. <strong>Google</strong>&rsquo;s competition in the&nbsp; cloud computing market &nbsp;includes <strong>Amazon</strong> ( AMZN ), <strong>Microsoft</strong> ( MSFT ), and <strong>Oracle</strong> ( ORCL ). If marketers perceive <strong>Alphabet</strong> as a threat to their businesses because of conflicts of interest in ad placement, they could ditch the platform and instead buy ads from <strong>Alphabet</strong>&rsquo;s rivals such as <strong>Facebook</strong> ( FB ),<strong> Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> ( TWTR ), and<strong> Yelp</strong> ( YELP ), dealing <strong>Alphabet</strong>&nbsp;a major blow.</p>
