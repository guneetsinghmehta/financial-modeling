After Amazon ( AMZN ) pledged to create more than 100,000 new full-time US jobs over the next 18 months, Wall Street has been looking for clues on where the jobs will come from. It seems Amazon is betting on retail infrastructure expansion to produce the jobs it promised, which would increase its number of full-time employees to 280,000 by mid-2018. As shown in the chart above, Amazon’s workforce has increased sharply since 2011. If infrastructure development is going to produce the jobs pledged, a new fulfillment facility in Coppell, Texas, appears to be part of the play. Amazon plans to open its third warehouse in the Coppell area, which will yield an additional 1,000 full-time jobs. The company already operates seven fulfillment centers in Texas, which employ more than 10,000 full-time workers. In addition to the new Coppell facility, Amazon plans to open its first air cargo hub at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, which could yield more than 2,000 new jobs. Expanding its warehouse network is important to Amazon’s growth, as it supports its Fulfillment by Amazon operation. Through the program, the company delivers goods on behalf of third-party merchants for a fee. As the e-commerce industry grows and legacy retailers such as Walmart ( WMT ), Sears ( SHLD ), Target ( TGT ), and Costco Wholesale ( COST ) try to catch up with Amazon, the company has started using its infrastructure to generate additional revenue by offering third-party shipping services . Amazon opened 26 fulfillment centers last year. It is set to open more this year as it seeks to fulfill its job promise and grow its top line. Quote data by Xignite
