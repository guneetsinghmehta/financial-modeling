Earlier in the series, we discussed how <strong>Hewlett-Packard Enterprise</strong>s ( HPE ) recent acquisition of SimpliVity could benefit it in the HCI (hyper-converged infrastructure) space. We also learned that <strong>VMware</strong> ( VMW ), a pioneer in virtualization software, also aims to benefit from the wave trending in the direction of HCI technology. Stating his views on <strong>SimpliVitys</strong> acquisition, a leading chief technology officer wishing not to be identified shared with CRN.com, Now HPE is instantly in the hyper-converged conversation and mix. That is exactly what happened in the wireless market when HPE bought Aruba. HPE had no real legitimate play there, and then all of a sudden HPE was on every networking customer list right beside <strong>Cisco</strong>. When HP announced its acquisition of Aruba, it was the second-largest player after <strong>Cisco</strong> ( CSCO ) in terms of market share in the enterprise wireless network market. <strong>HP</strong> was the fourth-ranked player in the market. By acquiring Aruba, <strong>HP</strong> not only made a swift jump in the networking space but also posed direct competition to <strong>Cisco</strong> . John Barker, CEO of Versatile and an HPE-<strong>Aruba</strong> platinum partner, believes an HPE-<strong>Simplivity</strong> deal to be every bit as big a game-changer as HPE <strong>Aruba</strong>. As reported by arnnet.com, Technology Business Research expects global hyper-converged revenue to rise 53.1% to reach $7.2 billion by 2020. Moreover, 32% of customers are expected to replace their current hardware with hyper-converged options, while 25% are cutting other areas of IT (information technology) expenditure to fund HCI purchases. As <strong>VMware</strong> is now mostly held by <strong>Dell</strong>, following its acquisition of <strong>EMC</strong> ( <strong>EMC</strong> ), it will have greater access to funds to improve its scale and footprint in the cloud and HCI spaces. The HCI space is dominated by startups and small players with limited resources. As a result, enterprise adoption in the space is likely slower. By acquiring SimpliVity, HPE not only aims to gain a larger share of the HCI space but also to gain an edge over <strong>VMware</strong>. Moreover, increased competition among major players such as <strong>VMWare</strong> and HPE should bring focus to this market and speed up its adoption. Quote data by <strong>Xignite</strong>
