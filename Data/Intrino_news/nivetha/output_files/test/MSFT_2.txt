<strong>Facebook Inc</strong>. ( FB ) is looking to take on a whole new level of competition with another colossal tech company, <strong>Microsoft Corp</strong>. ( MSFT ). The social media giant is rolling out a new feature on its <strong>Facebook</strong> platform to address employment, similar to what <strong>LinkedIn</strong> has done in the past. Keep in mind that Microsoft only recently completed its acquisition of <strong>LinkedIn</strong>. The question is who will win this clash of the titans. This expansion by <strong>Facebook</strong> could ultimately hurt <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and<strong> Microsoft</strong> if this business platform gains traction. Currently, <strong>Facebook</strong> is used by over 1.2 billion people on a daily basis, with monthly active users totaling closer to 1.9 billion. So this is a big pool to draw from, but execution will be key.

Much like a temp agency or a staffing service, <strong>Facebook</strong> could look to generate revenues akin to a finders fee. There are some key differences between the <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>LinkedIn</strong> platform. First, the jobs listed on each seem to have a wide difference; <strong>Facebook</strong> is offering more temp or part-time jobs, while<strong> LinkedIn</strong> is offering more skilled positions. Also <strong>LinkedIn</strong> has a more detailed section for a resume than <strong>Facebook</strong> currently offers. As previously mentioned,<strong> Facebook</strong> has close to 1.9 billion users, while <strong>LinkedIn</strong> has just below 500 million users.
