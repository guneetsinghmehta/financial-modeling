(Photo credit: Herwig Vergult/AFP/Getty Images) DuPont has reached a $670.7 million cash settlement over lawsuits related to the exposure of a toxic chemical from a West Virginia plant. The company said on Monday it has settled 3,550 personal injury lawsuits tied to the contamination of perfluorooctanoic acid from its Parkersburg, West Virginia plant in the area's drinking water. The chemical is used to make Teflon non-stick pans and other water and grease repellent products, like water-proof jackets and bags of microwave popcorn. Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015, will pay half the settlement amount. Both companies denied any wrongdoing. DuPont stopped using the chemical at the Washington Works plant, which sits just across the river from Ohio, more than a decade ago. In 2005, it was slapped with a $16.5 million penalty from the Environmental Protection Agency for hiding information about its use of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and the potential impact on neighboring communities. In 2006, DuPont, 3M and other large companies agreed to phase out and eventually eliminate use of the chemical in their products. PFOA has been linked to various diseases, including testicular and kidney cancer, and the EPA has issued a health advisory for the chemical. Shares of DuPont were flat in pre-market trading, while Chemours spiked 11%.
