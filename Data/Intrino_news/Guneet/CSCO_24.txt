<p>Shares of <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> ( CSCO ) are up 84 cents, or 2.6%, at $33.66, adding to gains throughout the session, and reversing a small decline last night, after the company yesterday afternoon reported fiscal Q2 revenue slightly higher than consensus, and forecast this quarter&rsquo;s revenue slightly higher. Both CEO and CFO explained the transformation of the company to a software-centric outfit following the call. The focus today is on the recurring revenue component, which is encouraging to many. So is the 12% hike in the dividend . Security technology &nbsp;was, as usual, a stand-out area of revenue strength. Another bright spot: &nbsp;service provider &nbsp;orders in the quarter were flat with the prior-year period, versus a 2% decline in the quarter before, a relief to the Street. Among things people didn&rsquo;t like were weakness in routing and switching, in particular a continued decline in spending by companies on &ldquo;campus&rdquo; switching products. There are no ratings changes today, but some price target increases here and there. Among the bulls, even things that they didn&rsquo;t like were subsumed under the transformation the company&rsquo;s talking about. Simon Leopold of <strong>Raymond James</strong> &nbsp;reiterates an Outperform rating, and raises his price target a buck. He was surprised by the switching and routing erosion, on the one hand: Although we were worried about the lack of a December enterprise budget flush, we were negatively surprised that Switching sales dropped 5% y/y and missed our estimate by $143 million. Routing also disappointed us, dropping 10% y/y and missing our estimate by $96 million as Service providers remain challenging. Data center was also weak dropping 4% y/y. Nevertheless, Leopold notes that the &ldquo; metamorphosis &rdquo; is evident: <strong>Cisco</strong> continues to show progress on its initiative to evolve into a software centric company. Deferred revenue grew 13% year over year, with product deferred revenue up 19% while service deferred revenue increased by 9% during the same period. The increase in product deferred revenue was largely attributed to <strong>Cisco&rsquo;s</strong> subscription based and software offerings, and product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription business increased 51% year over year, with Collaboration, Security, and Wireless (<strong>Meraki</strong>) business driving the bulk of the contributions. Pierre Farragu with Bernstein reiterates and Outperform rating, and a $37 price target, writing that his &ldquo;these is playing out&rdquo; on the company, namely that recurring revenue is becoming a more meaningful part of the business: Deferred revenues related to subscriptions were up ~51% to $4bn. We estimate subscriptions in the quarter were ~$850m or ~10% of product revenues and represented an overall headwind of ~1pt. Although gross margins were a bit below our expectations, the slight weakness was due to normal ups and downs in business activity. In particular, management called out DRAM pricing and a benefit from a Chinese national program that they had a year ago as a part of the movement this quarter. As far as switching, Farragu advises that &ldquo;we see Campus as a source of positive surprise in coming quarters. <strong>Barclays</strong> &rsquo;s Mark Moskowitz , who has an Overweight rating on the shares, and a $34 price target, thinks that the stock may trade sideways, but that you should &ldquo;add or build positions in the stock if there is any near-term weakness. The &ldquo;big story&rdquo; is &ldquo;the subscription model and thereby the predictability of cash flow&rdquo;: As for the long term, the key hurdle is whether the company can demonstrate its subscription and software focused strategy can work. Here, accelerating growth in deferred revenue is a suitable test. That was on full display in Jan-Q, and alongside strong free cash flow, should keep a balanced debate between the Bulls and Bears. From the bear camp, <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> &nbsp;analyst Kulbinder Garcha &nbsp;reiterates an Underperform rating on the shares, though he raises his target to $27 from $25, writing that he&rsquo;s concerned the company is running out of ways to offset the decline in switching : Our concern is that some of levers <strong>Cisco</strong> have had in recent quarters to offset switching decline may be running out. For example in the current quarter, 4 of 9 divisions saw a revenue decline on a y/y basis, with previously strong growth areas such as Datacenter again in decline. Also, while the company has executed very well on the cost front, additional GM leverage is unlikely with the company noting slightly heightened pricing and reporting product GM of 62.4%, which is close to record highs. We project OM at 30.7%/30.3% for FY 17/18. Error message Be the first to leave a comment on this blog.
