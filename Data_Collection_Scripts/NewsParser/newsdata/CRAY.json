He constantly thanked the audience for its kindness in his second show at Irving Plaza on Wednesday night, and his microphone was positioned a little low so he appeared to be bowing to the audience when he sang. As a singer and guitarist, the 41-year-old Mr. Cray was polite but never overly mannered. Every element was in place in his songs, every note meant something. He strummed minor chords on his guitar lightly, almost hesitantly, pausing for crisp blues solos that were everything but showy. He sang in the smooth, wounded voice of a singer who values pop as much as soul and the blues, like Bobby (Blue) Bland, occasionally switching into rougher, rawer Howlin' Wolf-style phrases.","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Courteous Robert Cray And a Friend: Heartbreak","kicker":"MUSIC REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CRAY, ROBERT"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"1995-08-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Neil","rank":1,"lastname":"STRAUSS"}],"original":"By NEIL STRAUSS"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1d0f18eb7c8105d70b25d","word_count":411,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1988\/12\/13\/nyregion\/nursing-home-operators-indicted.html","snippet":"LEAD: A husband and wife were indicted yesterday on charges of operating an unlicensed Harlem nursing home, stealing from residents and keeping an 81-year-old resident at the home against his will, the Manhattan District Attorney announced....","lead_paragraph":"LEAD: A husband and wife were indicted yesterday on charges of operating an unlicensed Harlem nursing home, stealing from residents and keeping an 81-year-old resident at the home against his will, the Manhattan District Attorney announced.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Nursing Home Operators Indicted"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CRAY, BENJAMIN"},{"name":"persons","value":"CRAY, LUCILLE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"HARLEM (NYC)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"EMBEZZLEMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"LICENSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NURSING HOMES"}],"pub_date":"1988-12-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"The Associated Press","original":"By The Associated Press","person":[]},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd195f18eb7c8105d6a2a68","word_count":297,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9E07E5DC143DE036A05754C1A96E9C946490D6CF","snippet":"Don Gold lr disputes Ed Cray's July 6 rev of his book, Bellevue.

It emerged in the few hundred miles of the Mississippi Delta and then traveled with its practitioners north to the ghettos of Memphis, St. Louis and Chicago. Far from harming or limiting the music, this kind of isolation infused the blues with its power, its passion, its acute and aching detail. Robert Cray, for geographical reasons among many others, embodies a very different, modern idea of the blues. The 33-year-old guitarist and songwriter is a man from nowhere in particular, born in Georgia, raised in America and abroad as an ''Army brat,'' and schooled in the blues in Tacoma, Wash., and Eugene, Ore., two places a long way from Highway 61, the Illinois Central Railroad or any other traditional blues byway.","abstract":null,"print_page":"23","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ROBERT CRAY'S BLUES EMBODY A DIFFERENT, MODERN IDEA"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CRAY, ROBERT"},{"name":"subject","value":"RECORDINGS (AUDIO)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"1986-11-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Samuel","middlename":"G.","lastname":"FREEDMAN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By SAMUEL G.
