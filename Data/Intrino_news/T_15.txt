In the telecommunications world, 5G (fifth-generation) technology is generating a lot of hype, as it could provide ten to 100 times faster wireless speeds than 4G (fourth-generation) technology. Verizon’s ( VZ ) progress in the 5G space continues. The company believes that it will be the first major US carrier to deploy 5G technology on its network, although that probably won’t happen until the end of 2017—and only as a fixed wireless broadband solution. 5G services need connections to fiber-optic networks in dense urban areas. If Verizon does propose to acquire Charter Communications ( CHTR ), it could be interested in its fiber and coaxial cable infrastructure for 5G technology. Through a Charter acquisition, Verizon would gain a dense fixed fiber network in several major metropolitan areas, including a backhaul network that would help the company’s 5G efforts. Early in 2016, Verizon acquired XO Communications for $1.8 billion. XO will provide Verizon with fiber-optic networks in 40 major US markets. The pending acquisition will help support Verizon’s services for enterprise and wholesale customers and enable it to continue to densify its wireless cell network to both enhance 4G LTE (long-term evolution) coverage and provide the basics for an eventual 5G wireless rollout. AT T (T) has also been an aggressive player in the 5G market. Even in the past, it’s tried to outbid its rivals in order to gain spectrum advantage. AT T was the highest bidder during the AWS-3 spectrum auctions in early 2015, purchasing spectrum worth $18.2 billion. The AWS-3 spectrum auction was the major auction conducted by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) after 2008. As seen in the graph above, Verizon and T-Mobile ( TMUS ) also participated in the auction and made winning bids of $10.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Verizon is working on its 5G initiative with Cisco ( CSCO ), Nokia ( NOK ), Ericsson ( ERIC ), Intel ( INTC ), and Samsung ( SSNLF ). Quote data by Xignite
