This prickly psycho-sexual bramble bush of a movie, which opens the 16-film series ''Instituto Cervantes Spanish Cinema Now'' at the Walter Reade Theater today, focuses on a portly middle-aged gay professor of medieval literature who is dying of an unidentified illness and putting his life in order before carrying out an assisted suicide. On discovering that his most brilliant student, a smoldering nihilistic rebel (whose father also killed himself) has impregnated the daughter of his best friend, the professor hatches a plan to make the child his heir. For decades, the professor was unrequitedly in love with the girl's father, who is now his trusted university colleague. At the same time, the professor is masochistically infatuated with his favorite student, whom he discovers is moonlighting as a male hustler.","abstract":"Stephen Holden Critic's Choice review of movie Amic\/Amat (Friend), which opens Instituto Cervantes Spanish Cinema Now event at Walter Reade Theater;
