Play 01:57 Dobell: Cook served England with distinction Alastair Cook 's decision to resign from the England captaincy stemmed from his reservations about "how much he had left in the tank", according to Andrew Strauss, England's director of cricket, who says that the ECB expects to be able to name his successor within a fortnight, ahead of the one-day squad's departure for the Caribbean on February 22. Speaking at Lord's on the day it was confirmed that Cook, 32, would be standing down from the captaincy after a record 59 Tests in charge, Strauss praised the considered manner in which his former opening partner had reached his decision. The timing of Cook's announcement leaves his successor - almost certainly Joe Root - a full four months of preparation before England's next Test series against South Africa in July. "This wasn't one of those situations when it was right for me to persuade him to carry on," Strauss, from whom Cook inherited the captaincy back in 2012, told Sky Sports at Lord's. "I've been there myself. You either know if you have got it in you to carry on, or, deep down, you know it's time to step aside. "He did it the right way. He didn't jump to conclusions, he allowed the dust to settle after the India tour, he took some time to speak to the people closest to him, whom he trusted. I support and understand that decision." Cook's resignation had been on the cards ever since the tour of India in December, which finished with back-to-back innings defeat for a dispiriting 4-0 scoreline. As he had indicated at the time, Cook chose not to make a snap decision, but instead took the opportunity to take stock before informing Strauss of his intentions when the pair met up in January. "When the India tour finished, Alastair said to everyone that he'd sit down with me and talk things through," Strauss said, "both the learnings from the India tour and what the England team could do to get better, but also his own position. "We met up in January and I was interested to see how he had fared in India. I know how draining the England captaincy can be, especially on a long tour away from home when you are on the wrong end of the result. "So we had a conversation around that, and it was pretty clear that Alastair knew how much drive, determination and energy was going to be required of the England captain in the next 12 months or so. "He had some thoughts and reservations about how much he had left in the tank as England's longest-serving Test captain, and it was right that we didn't jump to conclusions, and let the dust settle. I allowed him to go away and think further. But, over the last ten days or so, it was clear his mind was made up." Andrew Strauss discusses Alastair Cook's decision to stand down as England captain Getty Images Despite the speculation that has surrounded the role, Strauss insisted that the search for Cook's successor would only now begin in earnest. "There is a process to go through," he said. "It would have been entirely wrong for me to have spoken to other players about the captaincy before Alastair stepped down, and especially while two important white-ball series were going on in India. "Now's the chance for myself and selectors, and the coach, to have conversations amongst ourselves and some players in the England environment, to get an understanding of who the right person is, what their philosophy is, and how they intent to take the team forward, so that when we come to announce the new captain, we are sure he's the right man." Although Root is the outstanding candidate to inherit Cook's role, his lack of captaincy experience is a justifiable concern - he has led in only four matches to date in his first-class career. Strauss, however, played down that aspect of his candidature. "That is the reality in this day and age," he said. "It's very hard for England players to get a great deal of county captaincy experience. But on one level there's only so much you can do to prepare yourself. I think playing in the set-up for a number of years and understanding the demands is more important. "[Cook's decision] gives the new captain a huge amount of time to get used to the idea and have conversations about off-the-field stuff with the coaches and support staff, so that when he steps on the field for the first time as England captain in July, a lot of that stuff will already be taken care of."

He will learn a lot from Cook experience. Cook has been a great Captain . Tours to subcontinent is always tough. I don't think that if Root was the Captain on India tour the result would have been any different . He took upon himself the defeat and resigned on his own terms . Cook has lots of cricket left in him and I hope we shall see a different Cook . GWill1990 on February 6, 2017, 19:52 GMT @Nutcutlet Pretty much agree with you RE. Root. He deserves the chance to lead if he wants it. You mention the potential issue with playing all formats but the likes of Kohli et al. have shown that it is possible to play in all formats. If anything, Root has it easier in that he doesn't have to worry about the SF captaincy like the others. The only possible cloud is that Root is a first-time father and only he will know how that may (or may not) affect his candidacy. We only have to look at Cook himself, who looked depressed having missed the birth of his second child recently, to see how important family time is; and let's face it, England's schedule this year is brutal. Cricklife on February 6, 2017, 19:28 GMT May be little weird..... Why not Jimmy Anderson for captaincy.. He has the experience. Nutcutlet on February 6, 2017, 18:53 GMT IMO, Root has not been named immediately, following Cook's resignation in order to lend a decent interval to proceedings. There cannot be any doubt that Joe Root will take over. He is the only batsman absolutely assured of his place, bar Cook and the young Hameed when next fit. The consultation process (aka 'conversations') to which Strauss alludes - is just to demonstrate that nothing is being done in haste and allow everyone to have a say... getting them on board, as it were. I have often thought that ideally the captain should bat at 3, 4, or 5 - not an opener. I hope that captaincy brings the best out of JR, the batsman. Too often in recent times he has gifted his wicket when well set. He is ideally suited to batting in Test cricket and not in LO cricket with its emphasis on scoring at a busy or frenetic rate. Part of his (and everyone else's) frustration in Tests has come from his seeming confusion in batting in the different formats; it's a curse of the age for the Test purist. Exfactor44 on February 6, 2017, 18:15 GMT Why not bring Ian Bell out of retirement? - he is captain of Worcester, has a lot of experience and has been in good form in 20 and 50 over - could coach Root into the Captaincy. I agree with the idea that Bairstow could make a good captain, but I still think Root is the standout candidate. newburychap on February 6, 2017, 18:05 GMT DC75 - no need to burden Root with all three formats. Buttler can take Morgan's place when he goes, he's already shown he's up to the job. DC75 on February 6, 2017, 17:41 GMT Root may be the obvious choice but I think Bairstow would be a better option than Root, may be I am wrong, but at least make Bairstow captain for ODI team and not burden JR with captaincy in all three formats once Morgan decides to leave. CricketChat on February 6, 2017, 16:58 GMT I guess a 0-2 or even a 1-3 loss would have given Cook an outside chance at continuation, but a 0-4 humiliation inclusive of innings defeats meant Cook would be at the mercy of Strauss and selection committee had he chosen to continue in the captaincy role. In that sense, I really appreciate and support the decision he took instead of it being taken out of his hands. Root has been touted about being the only choice for test captaincy, so I unless he indicated he isn't ready, I don't know what are the reasons for delay. He is the only batsman assured of his place in the side by default and has a thinking brain. Root for tests and Morgan for white ball cricket for the next one year unless the leaders themselves opt out for personal reasons or lack of form. No need for uncertainty. simba1908 on February 6, 2017, 20:15 GMT I ageee with exfactor44 about ian bell. Why not?
