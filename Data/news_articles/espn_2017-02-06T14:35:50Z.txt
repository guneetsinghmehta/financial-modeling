After Jimmy Garoppolo excelled in two games as Tom Brady's fill-in, he projects to be a major trade target this offseason. But what can the Patriots hope to get in return?

It's going to be an intriguing several months for the Patriots, regardless. That is because New England faces important strategic decisions regarding a long list of prominent contributors to its latest championship effort. How will the Patriots proceed from here?

They will keep looking for quarterbacks if they have to." Become an insider and get access to all our articles and tools. Magazine subscribers: activate your Insider account.
