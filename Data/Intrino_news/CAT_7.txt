CATERPILLAR INC 15-Feb-2017 Annual Report Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary
statements and significant risks to the company's business under Item 1A. Risk
Factors of the 2016 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Our sales and revenues for 2016 were $38.537 billion, down $8.474 billion, or 18
percent, from $47.011 billion in 2015. Sales declined across the company
reflecting weak end-user demand in most of the industries we serve including in
construction, oil and gas, mining and rail. A loss of $67 million was incurred
in 2016, compared with profit of $2.512 billion in 2015. The decline was
primarily due to lower sales volume, the unfavorable impact of higher
mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and other
postemployment benefits (OPEB) plans, unfavorable price realization and a
goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries. These unfavorable items were
partially offset by lower costs resulting from restructuring and other cost
reduction actions. Fourth-quarter 2016 sales and revenues were $9.574 billion, a 13 percent
decrease from $11.030 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. A loss of $1.171
billion was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a loss of $94
million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The loss was $2.00 per share in the
fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a loss per share of $0.16 in the fourth
quarter of 2015. Profit declined primarily due to the unfavorable impact of
increased mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB
plans, a goodwill impairment charge and lower sales volume. These unfavorable
items were partially offset by lower costs resulting from restructuring and
other cost reduction actions and lower restructuring costs.
Highlights for 2016 include: • Sales and revenues in 2016 were $38.537 billion, down 18 percent from 2015.
Sales declined in all segments and all regions. • Results for both 2015 and 2016 included significant restructuring costs and
2016 also included three large non-cash items. • Restructuring costs were $1.019 billion in 2016, or $1.16 per share,
compared with restructuring costs of $898 million in 2015, or $0.98 per
share. • Mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans
were $985 million in 2016, or $1.15 per share, a significant increase from
mark-to-market losses in 2015 of $179 million, or $0.19 per share. • Results for 2016 included a goodwill impairment charge in Resource
Industries of $595 million, or $0.98 per share. • Results for 2016 included a $141 million charge to increase deferred tax
valuation allowances, or $0.24 per share. • The loss per share was $0.11 for 2016, and excluding the above items, adjusted
profit was $3.42 per share. For 2015, profit per share was $4.18, and
excluding restructuring costs and mark-to-market losses, adjusted profit was
$5.35 per share. • Inventory declined about $900 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. For
the full year, inventory decreased about $1.1 billion. • Machinery, Energy Transportation (ME T) operating cash flow for 2016 was
about $3.9 billion, more than sufficient to cover capital expenditures and
dividends. Restructuring Costs In 2016, we continued to undertake a wide range of actions across the enterprise
to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions.
Restructuring costs of $395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 were related
to restructuring programs across the company. During 2016, we incurred $1.019
billion in restructuring costs, primarily related to Resource Industries and
Energy Transportation. In 2017, we expect restructuring actions to continue
and anticipate costs of about $500 million.
Notes: • Effective January 1, 2016, we made several changes that impacted the
accounting for pension and other postemployment benefits. We also made
changes to organizational accountabilities and internal reporting that
impacted segment results. Our 2015 financial information has been recast to
be consistent with the 2016 presentation. • Glossary of terms included on pages 47 to 49; first occurrence of terms shown
in bold italics. • Information on non-GAAP financial measures is included on pages 62-63. Table of Contents 2016 COMPARED WITH 2015 CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES [[Image Removed: cons-salesandrev2016q4ytd.jpg]]
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated
Sales and Revenues between 2015 (at left) and 2016 (at right). Items favorably
impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding
dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and
revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in
parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts
internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and
employees. Total sales and revenues were $38.537 billion in 2016, compared with $47.011
billion in 2015, a decline of $8.474 billion, or 18 percent. The decrease was
primarily due to lower sales volume attributable to continued weak commodity
prices globally and economic weakness in many countries. While sales for both
new equipment and aftermarket parts declined, most of the decrease was for new
equipment. The unfavorable impact of price realization, primarily in
Construction Industries, also contributed to the decline. Sales volume was also unfavorably impacted by changes in dealer machine and
engine inventories as inventories decreased about $1.6 billion in 2016 compared
with a decrease of about $1.0 billion in 2015. The unfavorable impact of changes
in dealer inventories was primarily in North America. Dealers are independent,
and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels, including
their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand
expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions,
machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on
availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution
centers. We believe some of the expected dealer inventory reduction is a result
of increased machine availability through our factories and product distribution
centers. We do not expect dealers will reduce inventories in 2017 as much as
they did in 2016. We believe the level of dealer inventories at the end of 2017
will depend on dealer expectations for business in 2018. Sales declined in all regions. In North America, sales decreased 19 percent due
to lower end-user demand primarily driven by Construction Industries and Energy Transportation, and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories,
primarily in Construction Industries. In EAME, sales declined 22 percent,
primarily in Africa/Middle East due to weak economic conditions resulting from
low oil and other commodity prices and an uncertain investment environment.
Sales decreased 29 percent in Latin America, primarily due to widespread
economic weakness across the region. The most significant decreases were in
Mexico and Brazil. Asia/Pacific sales declined 9 percent, primarily due to lower
end-user demand for Energy Transportation applications and products used in
mining, partially offset by an increase in demand for construction equipment
mostly in China. Energy Transportation's sales declined 22 percent, largely due to lower
end-user demand for oil and gas and transportation applications. Construction
Industries' sales decreased 12 percent due to lower demand from end users,
unfavorable price realization and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer
inventories. Resource Industries' sales declined 26 percent, mostly due to
continued low end-user demand. Financial Products' segment revenues were about
flat. Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT [[Image Removed: cons-opprofit2016q4ytd.jpg]]
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated
Operating Profit between 2015 (at left) and 2016 (at right). Items favorably
impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding
dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit
appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses
above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to
visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The
bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy Transportation other operating (income) expenses. Operating profit for 2016 was $498 million, compared with $3.785 billion in
2015. The decrease in profit is primarily due to lower sales volume, including
an unfavorable mix of products. Our expectation is that sales mix will continue
to be unfavorable in 2017. The decrease in profit also includes an unfavorable
impact from mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and
OPEB plans and a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries. In addition,
price realization, Financial Products and restructuring costs were unfavorable.
These items were partially offset by favorable period costs and variable
manufacturing costs. The unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions,
primarily in Construction Industries. We saw competitive pressure during 2016
that started in the last half of 2015 driven by excess industry capacity,
unfavorable currency pressure as the impact of the strong dollar benefited
competitors based outside the United States and an overall weak economic
environment. While we do not expect substantial price improvement in the coming
months, we do expect price realization to be neutral to slightly positive in
2017. Period costs were lower, primarily due to the impact from substantial
restructuring and cost reduction actions and lower short-term incentive
compensation expense. The reductions primarily impacted period manufacturing
costs and selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A). Variable
manufacturing costs were favorable primarily due to improved material costs and
the favorable impact of cost absorption. Cost absorption was favorable due to
inventory decreasing more significantly in 2015 compared to the decrease in
2016. Restructuring costs of $1.019 billion in 2016 were related to multiple
restructuring actions across the company, primarily in Resource Industries and
Energy Transportation. In 2015, restructuring costs were $898 million.
Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and
operational performance measured against targets set annually. Expense in 2016
was about $250 million as compared to about $585 million in 2015. For 2017, we
expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be significantly higher
than 2016. Other Profit/Loss Items • Other income/expense in 2016 was income of $146 million, compared with
income of $161 million in 2015. The unfavorable change was primarily due
to the absence of a gain of $120 million on the sale of the remaining 35
percent Table of Contents interest in our former third-party logistics business. This was mostly offset by
a favorable net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses.
Currency translation and hedging net losses in 2016 were significantly less than
the net losses in 2015. • The provision for income taxes for 2016 reflects an annual effective tax
rate of 36.4 percent compared to 25.5 percent for 2015, excluding the
items discussed in the paragraph below. The increase is primarily due to
the negative impact from the portion of the Surface Mining Technology
goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes offsetting a favorable
geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. The effective tax rate
related to 2016 full-year adjusted profit before tax is 26 percent. The provision for income taxes for 2016 also includes a $141 million non-cash
charge for increases in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax
assets due to recent U.S. GAAP losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state
jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income
tax accounting guidance. The provision for income taxes for 2015 also included a
$42 million net charge to adjust prior years' U.S. taxes. Segment Information

Consolidated Operating Profit $ 498 $ 3,785 $ (3,287 ) (87 )% Construction Industries Construction Industries' sales were $15.612 billion in 2016, a decrease of
$2.185 billion, or 12 percent, from 2015. The decrease in sales was primarily
due to lower volume and unfavorable price realization. While sales declined for
both new equipment and aftermarket parts, most of the decrease was for new
equipment. • The sales volume decline was primarily due to a decrease in deliveries to end
users and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Dealers
lowered inventories more significantly in 2016 than in 2015. • Price realization was unfavorable $539 million due to competitive market
conditions resulting from excess industry capacity and an overall weak
economic environment. Sales decreased in North America, EAME and Latin America and were higher in
Asia/Pacific. • In North America, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user
demand. The sales decline was also due to a decrease in dealer inventories in
2016 compared to relatively flat inventories in 2015. Unfavorable price
realization resulted from competitive market conditions. The availability of
used equipment has negatively impacted sales in North America during 2016 and
we expect some negative impact in 2017. • Lower sales in EAME were primarily due to lower end-user demand and the
unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. In addition, price
realization was unfavorable across the region due to competitive market
conditions. Dealer inventories decreased in 2016 while inventories remained
flat in 2015. We expect sales in Africa/Middle East to be negatively impacted Table of Contents in 2017 due to overall economic weakness and continued pressure on economies
that rely on oil revenues to drive economic growth. • In Latin America, end-user demand was down across most of the region, with
the most significant decline in Brazil due to weak economic conditions. • Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user
demand primarily in China stemming from increased government support in
infrastructure and residential investment. In addition, the impact of changes
in dealer inventories was favorable as inventories increased slightly in 2016
compared to a decrease in inventories in 2015. Construction Industries' profit was $1.650 billion in 2016, compared with $1.865
billion in 2015. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume
and unfavorable price realization resulting from competitive market conditions.
The decline was partially offset by favorable costs, primarily due to the impact
from restructuring and cost reduction actions, improved material costs, the
favorable impact of cost absorption and the absence of an unfavorable impact
from litigation in 2015. The impact of cost absorption was favorable as
inventory decreased more significantly in 2015 than in 2016. Resource Industries Resource Industries' sales were $5.726 billion in 2016, a decrease of $2.013
billion, or 26 percent, from 2015. The decline was almost entirely due to lower
sales volume. Sales were lower for both new equipment and aftermarket parts,
however, most of the decrease was for new equipment. Aftermarket parts sales
have increased sequentially in each of the last three quarters.
The sales decrease was primarily due to lower end-user demand across all
regions. While most commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter over a year
earlier, current prices have not been sufficient to drive an increase in
short-term demand for new equipment. We believe commodity prices must stabilize
for a longer period of time to positively impact our sales. We believe idle
mining trucks on customer sites are also having a negative impact on end-user
demand. In 2016, mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity
in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures, as they have
for several years. We believe miners' capital spending will be about flat in
2017 after several years of decline. However, we believe commodity prices at
higher levels than a year ago, along with sequential improvements in part sales
in each of the last three quarters of 2016 and improvements in quoting and order
activity in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflect positive trends in Resource
Industries that, if sustained, could positively impact future results.
Resource Industries incurred a loss of $1.047 billion in 2016, compared with
profit of $1 million in 2015. The most significant item impacting 2016 was a
goodwill impairment charge of $595 million related to the Surface Mining Technology reporting unit. Excluding the impairment charge, the remaining
unfavorable change was mostly due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price
realization. These items were partially offset by lower costs due to the impact
from restructuring and cost reduction actions, improved material costs and lower
short-term incentive compensation expense. Energy Transportation Energy Transportation's sales were $14.411 billion in 2016, a decrease of
$4.108 billion, or 22 percent, from 2015. The decrease was almost entirely the
result of lower sales volume. Sales decreased in all applications with oil and
gas and transportation representing nearly 80 percent of the Energy Transportation decline. • Oil and Gas - Sales continued to decrease in all regions due to low oil
prices. Although oil prices were low in 2015 and 2016, our sales during the
first half of 2015 benefited from a strong order backlog. The sales decline
was most significant in equipment used for production, drilling and well
servicing. • Transportation - Sales decreased in all geographic regions. The most
significant decline was in North America, primarily due to significant
weakness in the rail industry that we expect will persist in 2017. Rail
remains challenged with low traffic volume and a significant number of idle
locomotives. We believe our sales into the rail industry, including rail
services and aftermarket, are being negatively impacted by idled fleets
resulting from weak commodity prices. We expect the availability of our North
American Tier 4 freight locomotive offering to positively impact sales in
2017. In Asia/Pacific, the decrease was due to the absence of a large sale of
locomotives in 2015 and a decline in demand for equipment used in marine
applications, primarily for work boats. Demand in Latin America and EAME were
also negatively impacted by the weakness in the rail industry. • Power Generation - Sales decreased in all regions, but primarily in EAME. The
decline in EAME was primarily a result of continued weakness in the Middle
East with continued low oil prices limiting investments. We expect low oil
prices will continue to limit investments in oil-producing regions of
Africa/Middle East in 2017. The declines in both North America and
Asia/Pacific were primarily due to the absence of several large projects and
weakness in power generation demand for oil and gas development. The decline
in Latin America was primarily due to weak economic conditions. Table of Contents • Industrial - Sales were lower in EAME, North America and Latin America and
about flat in Asia Pacific. The decline in sales was primarily due to lower
end-user demand for most industrial applications. Energy Transportation's profit was $2.222 billion in 2016, compared with
$3.390 billion in 2015. The decline was due to a decrease in sales volume,
including an unfavorable mix of products. This was partially offset by lower
costs primarily due to restructuring and cost reduction actions, favorable
material costs and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Financial Products Segment Financial Products' revenues were $2.993 billion, a decrease of $85 million, or
3 percent, from 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower average earning
assets in Asia/Pacific and Latin America, an unfavorable impact from returned or
repossessed equipment, primarily in North America and lower average financing
rates in Latin America. These decreases were partially offset by higher average
financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America.
Financial Products' profit was $702 million in 2016, compared with $809 million
in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable impact from returned
or repossessed equipment, an unfavorable impact from lower average earning
assets, a decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting geographic
mix changes and an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial.
