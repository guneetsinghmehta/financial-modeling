ESPNcricinfo Ltd England allrounders Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes and their limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan are among the seven players who have listed themselves at the highest base price of INR 2 crore (approx US $298,000) for the IPL player auction scheduled in Bangalore on February 20. India seamer Ishant Sharma , Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews , and the Australian fast bowlers Mitchell Johnson and Pat Cummins are the rest of the players in this set. Also in the top bracket INR 1.5 crore : Johnny Bairstow, Trent Boult, Brad Haddin, Nathan Lyon, Kyle Abbott, Jason Holder Note: The currency conversion is at current dollar rates and the figures are approximate amounts) *INR 1 crore = INR 100 lakh = INR 10000000 = USD 149 thousand approx INR 1 lakh = INR 100 thousand = INR 100000 = USD 1490 approx A total of 799 players were part of the initial roster which would be pruned once the franchises submit their choices before the deadline this weekend. There were 160 capped players from eight countries - leaving out Bangladesh and Pakistan - and 639 from India, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and West Indies. Of the 24 capped Indian cricketers, everyone barring Ishant has listed their base price at INR 30 lakh. Considering they will have to put a majority of their players back into the auction in 2018, some franchise officials said they would not be too aggressive in buying players this season. However, they did agree that there would be considerable interest in the English players. Although the IPL is yet to decide on the retention rules, franchises expect the right-to-match option to be available. This allows franchises to buy back a specific number of the players they have released for the auction, by matching the highest bid those players attract; if they match the bid they win the player. With the impressive all-round skills he showed during England's recent tour of India, Stokes tops the list of marquee players that several franchises have said they would like to have. Play 00:47 Quick Facts: IPL 2017 Auction After Andrew Strauss took over as the ECB director of cricket last year, he has allowed England players the freedom to play in domestic T20 leagues like the IPL to gain wider exposure. Morgan, who has played for three different teams, Jos Butler (Mumbai Indians), Sam Billings (Delhi Daredevils), Chris Jordan (Royal Challengers Bangalore) have all commented on the positive influence of playing the IPL. Many England players who attended media briefings during the six-match limited-overs series in India last month spoke about the attraction of the IPL. Wicketkeeper batsman Jonny Bairstow (INR 1.5 crore), hard-hitting opening batsmen Alex Hales and Jason Roy (INR 1 crore) and fast bowlers Jordan and Tymal Mills (INR 50 lakh) have put their names up for auction. Franchises retained a total of 140 players and released 89 ahead of this IPL auction. Among those released and now trying to make a return are Johnson (Kings XI Punjab, INR 6.5 crore), Mathews (Delhi Daredevils, INR 7.5 crore), Ishant (Rising Pune Supergiants, INR 3.8 crore) and Morgan (Sunrisers Hyderabad, INR 1.5 crore). Former South Africa fast bowler Kyle Abbott , who recently moved to Hampshire as a Kolpak player, has listed his base price at INR 1.5 cr. Abott was bought by Kings XI in 2016 for INR 2.1 crore but was released in December. Another player attempting to make a return is New Zealand fast bowler Trent Boult , who was hired by Sunrisers in 2015 for INR 3.8 crore. Boult has now listed his base price at INR 1.5 crore. West Indies ODI captain Jason Holder has also kept his price at INR 1.5 crore. He was with Kolkata Knight Riders, who had bought him for INR 75 lakh in 2014, until last season. India left-arm spinner Pawan Negi , who was the second-most expensive player bought at last year's auction by the Daredevils for INR 8.5 crore comes into the auction with a base price of INR 30 lakh. Nagraj Gollapudi is a senior assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo Morgan is in good for me. He batted better than any other player from England in the completed tour. He is the only player who faced jadejas bowling with ease. I believe his best game is started and going to last long. hahahahaha, really every one of afghan cricket star , Nabi, Shahzad, Rashid, will be farbetter than this high priced players, they are the really winer of t20, the stars , hope to se them in IPL this year I think the foreign players influence must be curtailed in IPL. When IPL was started India did not had many T20 players, so foreign players needed. Now that there is more and more players emerging from domestic cricket, we can keep the number of foreign players in each team to 2 instead of 4. Also none of the teams should have foreign player as captain. Captaincy must be left to local players. These are the players whom I would expect franchisees to go very actively after : KKR : Stokes, Woakes, Abbott, Morgan. MI : Mathews, Hales, Pawan Negi. RCB : Tymal Mills, Woakes, Munro, Cummins. SRH : Seekuge Prasanna, Cummins, Imran Tahir, Pravin Tambe. RPS : Boult, Roy, Woakes, Johnson, Mills, RP Singh. GL : Stokes, Woakes, Johnson, Tymal Mills, Jason Holder. DD : Tymal Mills, Unmukt Chand. KXIP : Imran Tahir, Jason Roy, Paras Dogra, Seekuge Prasanna. Ben Stokes this year will be the most expensive overseas player . He will fetch atleast 1.2 million USD. Why do I feel like Johnny Bairstow, Jason Holder, Brad Haddin, Ishant Sharma will go unsold? Morgan is expensive too! IPL needs multi faceted player, at least foreign players because of the 4 per XI limitations or impact foreign players who make a bigggg difference in one department like Hales, Buttles or all rounders like Stokes, Woakes. Lol Ishant Sharma? 2 crore? This league is a joke RCB : Need bowlers! Especially Indian. So they will probably go for Ishant. They could also go for Tymal Mills.
MI : A well balanced team. Could go for Karn Sharma to lend support to Bhajji in the spin department.
KKR: Need international batsmen in their top order. So, they would probably be looking at Morgan, Bairstow or even Hales and Roy. Roy should be the one though.
SRH: Spinners! So young guns like M.Ashwin and Rasool.
DD: Backups for their injury prone pacers- Zak and Shami. So Nathu Singh, Irfan for them.
KXI: Jason Roy! They dearly need a big hitting opener. And an international pacer like Tymal Mills, Woakes. Could also go for Stokes.
RPS: Probably the weakest team, they need to get a lot of bases covered. They should go all out for Stokes and Boult. And indians like Negi, and a few young indian pacers like Nathu Singh.
GL: They would want a middle order player like Saurabh or Manoj Tiwary.
Plus a few bowlers with some 'Pace' unlike PK and Kulkarni. Would be interesting to see how Santner and Seekuge Prasanna fare in the auctions - would be handy all rounders for many franchisees though might be difficult to fit amongst the 4 overseas players for many of them... would be great to have them in the mix though.. The biggest joke is Nathan Lyon commanding a base price of 1.5 cr .. LOL :)))))) someone would really have to be completely out of their senses to pick him -;) Considering all the ungrateful SL cricket fans calling for his head, if I were Mathews, personally I would just retire and make a fortune playing in england, the IPL and other t20 leagues. His med pace offcutters are perfect in t20 and although he hasn't done well in the IPL his batting skill set is perfect for it and I predict he will do very well this year. Hopefully RCB will take him Morgan is in good for me. He batted better than any other player from England in the completed tour. He is the only player who faced jadejas bowling with ease.

Hopefully RCB will take him Srh wants a good spinner batsman's.warner only handling total pressure. My dream team is warner(c),dhawan,henriques,Ben cutting,yuvraj singh,naman ojha,pawan negi,bipul sharma,buvneswar Kumar, ashish nehra,musthafizur rehman.now we have 7 batsmen's without bipul sharma.8 bowlers including yuvi negi.5 allrounders with bipul sharma. Hates off to ishant sharma's managar for keeping high price cause he knows with restriction on number of indian player in each team, even in last(panic) round of auction one of the will throw any money to fill-up their indian fast bowler slot.. Id sat pay the likes of Ishant, Umesh and send them to county for a season or two provided they get picked. Ditto with Vijay, Pujara, Rahane KKR will pick Stokes especially with Russell not playing. He should be hot pick in the auction. KXIP should pick Imran Tahir as spin bowling is their weak link. Most Sri Lankan players are mediocre so would not expect them to be picked in the auction. Same is the case with Haddin and Lyon - am sure no one would pick them even for 30L ! Mathews would be lucky to be picked too given his base price. The only player from SL who should be picked is Seekuge Prasanna - a good spinning all rounder. Tymal Mills at 50L would be handy for many franchisees. @SAMPU_SHAIKH: Shaikh sahab, do you think Dhawan, Santner, Cutting, N.Ojha are good batsman. Yuvraj and Mooen are good, but inconsistent. No batsman in the team you have selected except Warner. Worst team ever. My un-elaborated observation about the positive benefits of playing IPL was related to the three English players mentioned in the article, none of whom demonstrated those benefits massively in the recent T20 India series despite all having played for at least one IPL series (more in Morgan's case). DD should just go for 1 big bid in the auctions. And that 1 guy should be Roy or Stokes. The 4 international players should be:
1) Quinton
2) Morris
3) Billings or Duminy (depending on form and opposition)
4) Roy / Stokes If they get Roy, Quinton and Roy can open with Pant at 3 If they get Stokes, Quinton and Pant can open with Stokes at 5 or 6. They can then also afford to play a 3rd spinner (Nadeem) instead of Shami. I know they have Brathwaite too, but its better to have a genuine allrounder like Stokes than a bits pieces guy who can hit big once a while. Quinton, Pant, Nair, Samson, Billings/Duminy, Stokes, Morris, Jayant, Zak, Mishra, Shami OR Quinton, Roy, Pant, Nair, Billings/Duminy, Samson, Morris, Jyant, Zak, Mishra, Nadeem How can a player lyk mathews put himself for so much amount when he is a failure in his own team.. I would rather lyk to watch Roy, Stokes, Billings, Mohd Shehzad, Mohd Nabi, Pant in this IPL.. Lol@ Ben Stokes' price. Over rated wasted space. Where's Tymal Mills? Him and The Fizz are gonna be the best death bowlers in the league SRH really needs a good wicket taking Indian spinner in the line up. Karn Sharma has been released. Not sure which spinner in the lot is up for grabs. They can't afford an overseas spinner (Moeen/Santner) since they let Eoin Morgan go as they already have Warner, Williamson and Henriques in red hot form and have Cutting as a back up. Mustafizur will grab the last overseas slot. I can only think of Negi, Tambe or M Ashwin. Can some one throw in some more Indian spinners into the list? Wish SRH could get Amit Mishra back. Letting him go was a mistake. As an RCB fan, what Virat needs is a couple of bowlers whom he can throw the ball and not worry about getting hit for 14+ runs in the final overs, which he was missing in the last season. With Starc being fit (as of now), Badri being available, Chahal Arvind doing nice and Watto's wicket taking skills, he needs another fast bowler who is atleast 70-80% Starc...Probably add another alrounder in case of Watto's injury OR to add some extra balance...I would like RCB to go with England's Mills, even though that will make 3 Lefties in the side, he seems really good for this format. I don't think Ishant Sharma did a wrong thing he's not someone many teams would want but being an Indian he had very high chances of being picked by one team so there won't be a bidding war for him but he is guaranteed to be sold so why not keep the base price itself high tough I agree by his standards it's damn too high so this is why Matthews was rested. Have to have him top notch for IPL. With Jayawardane at helm of affairs, MI might go for likes of Mathews, or Dickwelle, along with usual contenders like Stokes and Roy, or even Moeen Ali. KKR will also look for services of Mathews and will suit their low and slow turning tracks. Boult can be a hot property with Punjab/RCB looking for a premier fast bowler!
RCB might also go all out for Stokes with just 1 overseas slot left! but will face stiff competition from Gujarat Lions as well as they might be missing services of Dwyane Bravo! Ishant has really played smart here. Might get sold for his base price only, but thats a solid amount for a struggling T20 bowler! @cricfan58119642 good point mate but based on form and credentials I guess a certain Mohmand shezad is a good wicketkeepr batsman too also he's in the top 10 ranking in t20s but his inexperience might cost him and Bairstow or Haddin come as better options. also based on big bash performances Ben dunk and tim Paine are also the names that come up a very interesting auction is coming up Good luck to all the England players in the ipl continue to play well and be humble. @Arvpoov Argrawal I will be shocked if Sanga gets chosen over those two given he was dropped from Hobart Hurricanes mid-season this BBL just past. The man is not in t20 form. Haddin however had a decent season and Bairstow is a better player again. looking forward to Delhi Daredevils mad auction strategy again..... Cummins will get injured again, lol Sharm? Really! @anuajm. Really a smart move by Ishant. Will get to play maximum half of the matches and may not even get to bowl the full quota in majority of those matches. Hence, he might get to bowl max 20 overs in the entire tournament. So, he would end up earning Rs.10 lacs per over even if he gets selected at his base price! The few runs that he scores (if at all) and the catches that he latches on, will be a bonus for the franchise.
One should rather opt for players like Ben Stokes, Jason Ray, Angelo Mathews, Butler, etc. Often some players are available for so ridiculous price that for the price of one Ishant, one can get atleast four upcoming talented players. SRH: 1 WARNER (c) 2 Dhawan 3 N Ojha (wk) 4 Yuvraj 5 CUTTING 6 MOEEN/SANTNER 7 Hooda 8 Bhuvneshwar 9 Sran 10 Nehra 11 MUSTAFIZUR.... This team gives them a strong T20 top 6 batting line-up along with 8 genuine bowling options (5 seam and 3 spin). Hard to see a better team on paper. Jason Roy is my pick and top of the list. I don't own any franchise to hire him though! Hihihihi As long as teams don't just look at stats... must be what the likes of Stokes are praying hard all the time. I agree with Jason Roy being the better option. Far more consistent. Boult has a more realistic chance of getting in than Woakes. kkr r going to get ben stokes at higher price watch out I think SRH should opt back for Morgan but that increases the already lefty dominant side so a Jonny Bairstow or Brad Haddin or better Kumar sangakara(if he's in the list) for a middle order spot this also gives the team a good middle order batsman who is consistent and around whom others can hit around and if needed they themselves can also this gives Naman Ojha a chance to perform or if he doesn't bat good (his keeping skills are very good though) can be dropped and they can utilise they spot also someone like santner or Tahir for a good spinning option Even if a franchise has an unlimited purse, they wouldn't go for Ishant Sharma. 2cr for a player who is not a regular in the international arena due to poor form and injuries? Yeah right. Boult and Stokes would be top picks. Smart move by Ishant, as an Indian fast bowler, he has great chances of getting picked but interest levels will be low, so possibly one franchise will pick Ishant without any further bidding, better to get 2 crores rather than lose 50 l - 1 crore by listing themselves low. With England players, availability will be an issue but as usual MI might eye Stokes. Bairstow is a better option as he is a wk too. Roy looks the most exciting bet for IPL. No way Matthews is gettign 2 crores as well Woakes. I am hoping Abbott and Tymal Mills get a jackpot, they definitely deserve it as well should make an impact in IPL specially Mills, looks like a very good 20-20 bowler. Interesting auctions coming up!! pat Cummins is an interesting prospect he hits the deck hard with impressive speed and with his latest performances with bat in bid bash and for Aussies vs NZ he looks a good hard hitting all-rounder suited for t20s Although I like Roy and Hales I highly doubt they would be brought in this years auction. Reason being is what IPL Teams need is a 2 in 1 player and almost all 8 teams have seasoned and set top order batsmen. Last year Guppy and Khawaja suffered the same fate in the auction. And this years highest price would be undoubtedly goes for Ben Stokes and I am expecting either DD or KXIP to go big for him and am hoping RCB, MI to not to bid becuase all though this two teams bid what they do is bench him. Kyle abbot will have to play County according to his deal for majority of tone during the IPL so who'd buy him I have to say I would love to see J Roy batting with QDK! @espnfan59 there are 5 overseas players in your team Roy QDK Billings Morris and tymal also the world cup sensation Braithwaite is missing and finally no Jayant Yadav after his impressive performances in the last couple of matches in last year's IPL also his capabilities seen when he played for India against England Where are martin guptill jimmy nessham colin munro ben dunk tim paine chris lynn george bailey richardson pearson stoinis MI needs to buy Jason Roy to open with Rohit Sharma and probably they can bid for either Trent Boult or Pat Cummins as well as a backup for Lasith Malinga, who spends more time on treatment table than cricket field. @GEOFFBOYC Ask PAK players or their coach Arthur, he says we lose cause we don't play in IPL. Warner's captaincy came to the light in IPL only and so was Warne's. DD team - Roy Decock Pant Nair Shreyas Billings Morris Mishra Zaheer Shami Tymal I feel roy should have had a higher price. he performed exceptionally well in the odi series. and i hope kyle abbott is happy now. 20 million rupees will surely be enough to buy groceries and pay bills . he didnt have to leave south africa. Do players list their own base price? Some of these prices look rather high given that the players will be put back into the auction in 2018. Many of these players could end up being unsold, and might have been better off perhaps listing more realistic prices. DD should get Jason Roy Tymal Mills, imagine Roy Decock opening with Pant one down. Missleading statement in the report: players from Bangladesh are not banned from IPL like Pakistan players. Already two Bangladesh players r retained by their teams: Shakib and Mustafizur. Just this time IPL teams didn't consider any other Bangladesh players. pawan negi from 8.5 crore to 30 lakhs are Mathews and Ishant day dreaming? I wouldn't pay them 20lakhs forget about 2 crores. I wonder if the so-called positive influence of playing the IPL is in any way related to the players' bank balances rather than the improvement in their game. With Russel banned KKR are left with only 3 overseas player will be forced to go for seaming all rounder. Unfortunately no one can replace Russel's lower order hitting. Big loss for KKR and probably will make them go for change of strategy. Thisara Perera and Seekuge Prasanna will be the top picks in this time ipl auction BCCI should require each franchise to have a player from associate country in the roaster. Good for Mathews. Mind you he is a great player in all formats and has performed better in shorter format. He is better than Morgan... RCB should try to get Ben Stokes. RCB would be team to beat. RCB made mistake by keeping 8 overseas player now they can only buy 1 player. They shud av left Milne Shamzi. So that they could av gone for one fast bowler and one all rounder. RCB shud buy one among these 4 players Mathews Boult Rabada Morkel Morgan is not a top attraction. He has failed in IPL a lot more than he has succeeded. Stokes is definitely. no way ishant and Mathews are going to be sold at 2 crore ..they should have base price of 50 lakhs.. @keepcalmandslaptheumpire: It might be reflecting on new picks, Shakib is already part of KKR isn't it ? 799 players are the ones who weren't picked yet or probably left by the earlier franchises. Angelo Mathews must be day dreaming to list himself at the highest base price. Given the spate of injuries he suffered in recent past and becoming injury prone in general, I am expecting him to be unsold. What about Mustafizur for SRH? Is he allowed to play or this applicable only for bangaldeshi players are not part of any IPL team. They have only priced themselves at 2 crore rupees as they would find better things to do with their time if they dont get paid top bucks. Also they arnt that good - Stokes fails miserably five times out of every six with the bat, and with the orb is rarely trusted to bowl the full four. Woakes is a swing bowler, the only thing in even less demand than swing bowlers in the IPL is wicketkeepers. @KEEPCALMANDSLAPTHEUMPIRE: Shakib and Mustafizur have already been retained by KKR and SRH respectively.. How are any of those players barring Mathews listing themselves at a base price of 298,000 U.S dollars? Woakes is arguably the best and his base price should be at least half of that. Stokes is so hit and miss not to mention dreadful at playing spin and Morgan has done nothing in 5 or 6 seasons of IPL. I would pick up Mathews though provided he's fit and bowling as his bowling is probably better than his team mate Thisara Perera who usually gets picked and he has more changeups than Stokes. Also you mentioned there is no Bangladesh players does this mean there is no Shakib this time round? No featured comments at the moment.
