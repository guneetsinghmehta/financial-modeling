But the company said that sales of its new Power Macintosh models, introduced in March, were ahead of plan and partly compensated for slowing sales of older machines. Apple's earnings of 15 cents a share were well below the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, which was 22 cents. That did not account for a debt offering in February that cost about 5 cents a share.","abstract":null,"print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"APPLE COMPUTER INC.
