While theres been a lot of talk about one-time repatriation tax holiday freeing up billions in corporate cash for the largest tech companies, analysts at Goldman Sachs highlight certain policies advocated by President Donald Trump that stand to negatively impact big tech players such as <strong>Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.</strong> ( HPE ), <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> ( AAPL ) and others, along with providing insight on how plausible they see actual policy implementation. Regarding overall plausibility of banner Trump proposals regarding trade and immigration, <strong>Goldman</strong> says, "While final details are not yet known and certain proposals from both President Trump and Congress face fiscal and political hurdles, our economists see the most likely scenario as a somewhat scaled-down version of the proposals ..." The firm expects the Trump administration to settle on a corporate tax rate of 25%, a midpoint between the initially proposed 15% and the current 35% average rate. <strong>Goldman</strong> also foresees the administration lowering U.S. taxation of foreign corporate income with no destination-based tax while succeeding in implementing a one-time repatriation tax holiday for the piles of corporate cash stored overseas by U.S. tech companies. As for Trumps tough talk on imposing a 45% tariff on Chinese imports and scrapping NAFTA , <strong>Goldman</strong> foresees the possibility of protectionist restrictions to be enacted. "The trade policy changes in consideration ... would be negative for most U.S. tech companies given most of their products are manufactured overseas and thus, technically, imported," explained <strong>Goldman</strong>. An issue of particular importance is a newly proposed border-tax adjustment, also known as a destination-based tax system, which would tax products that are imported and subsidize those that are exported in attempts to bolster U.S. manufacturing. <strong>Goldman</strong> suggests such a system would hurt tech giants such as <strong>HP Enterprise</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> as they would be barred from deducting the costs of imported goods. With <strong>Apples</strong> cost of imports at 59% of total sales and HPEs at 64%, the policy could represent a blow to profit, result in a larger tax liability, and possible product price increases. Also of potential hazard to tech giants is the H1-B visa issue, in which Trump seeks to greatly reduce the number of highly skilled worker visas and thus restrict incoming talent from overseas. We would expect overall labor costs to increase across the tech universe, with the potential structural change in how IT consulting and outsourcing industry approaches its labor pyramid in terms of both seniority/offshore mix, wrote <strong>Goldman</strong>.
