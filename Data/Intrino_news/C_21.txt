Major US banks ( XLF ) are focusing on expanding their wealth management businesses to offset the negative impact on revenues from low-interest rates. Although the wealth management business doesn’t offer high margins, it has lower capital requirements than lending or capital markets businesses. In particular, this helps boost a bank’s ( JPM ) ( BAC ) (C) valuations. Like its peers, Wells Fargo ( WFC ) is focusing on gaining market share in the wealth management business. In June 2016, Wells Fargo’s CEO, Timothy Sloan, noted at the Bernstein 32nd Annual Strategic Decisions Conference, “We have about 10% of the deposits in the U.S., but we manage 2-ish percent of the wealth. So the biggest opportunity that we have is with our existing customer base. And so that’s easy to say, but what does it mean? “One of the items that we’ve highlighted for the last few years has been an effort and a partnership between our retail banking folks and our wealth management folks, to refer retail banking customers that would be brokerage customers or wealth management customers to our wealth and investment management group. And we’ve consistently now for the last three or four years referred and closed about $1 billion a month of referrals.” In 4Q16, Wells Fargo’s ( WFC ) Wealth Management unit recorded profits of $653 million, 10% higher year-over-year, and its revenues rose 2.5% to $4.1 billion. The fake account scandal did not seem to have a major impact on WFC’s Wealth Management business. Quote data by Xignite
