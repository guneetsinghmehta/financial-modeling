The strong recovery in global FICC (fixed income, currencies and commodities) trading activity over the second half of 2016 resulted in <strong>Goldman</strong>'s FICC trading desk contributing almost 25% of the investment bank's total revenues for the year compared to 21% in 2015. The FICC trading desks at each of the five largest U.S. banks reported an increase in their share of the bank's total revenues year-on-year. Notably, these operations were responsible for 16-19% of 2016 revenues for the diversified banking giants <strong>Citigroup</strong> and <strong>JPMorgan</strong>. To put this in perspective, <strong>JPMorgan</strong>'s FICC trading revenues were double what <strong>Goldman</strong> reported for year, but its diversified nature meant that the bank also reported total revenues that were more than three times the figure for <strong>Goldman</strong>. This highlights the sheer magnitude of FICC trading operations at <strong>JPMorgan</strong> and <strong>Citigroup</strong>. While FICC trading revenues are expected to remain upbeat in 2017, we expect their share in the top lines of <strong>Citigroup</strong>,<strong> JPMorgan</strong> as well as <strong>Bank of America</strong> to decline. This is because improving interest rates should boost net interest revenues for their retail and commercial banking divisions at a faster rate than FICC trading revenues are set to grow.
