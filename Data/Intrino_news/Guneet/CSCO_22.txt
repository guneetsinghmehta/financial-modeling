<p>BREAKING: &nbsp;Dow, S P 500 Stay Down; Nasdaq Inches Into Positive Ground Need to register? Current subscribers register here . At least eight analysts hiked their price targets on &nbsp;<strong>Cisco Systems</strong> ( CSCO ) stock following the computer networking leader's fiscal Q2 earnings report late Wednesday, sending Cisco's stock up. <strong>Cisco's</strong> deferred revenue from software and subscriptions jumped 51% to $4 billion for the quarter ended Jan. 28, a sign that its business model transformation may be gaining traction, though overall revenue fell year over year for the fifth straight quarter. If the Trump administration follows through on a proposal to give a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, Cisco could make more acquisitions targeting software and services, analysts say. Drexel Hamilton hiked its price target to 40 from 36, and <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> increased its to 40 as well. UBS and RBC Capital both hiked theirs to 37 from 35, while Oppenheimer increased its price target to 36 from 34. Piper Jaffray upped its to 36 from 32, while Pacific Crest Securities increased its to 34 from 33. <strong>Cisco</strong> stock rose 2.4% in the stock market today , to 33.60, earlier touching 33.97, its highest price since November 2007. <strong>Cisco</strong> stock on Tuesday climbed above a 32.05 buy point, so it's now slightly more than 5% extended. IBD'S TAKE: &nbsp; <strong>Cisco's</strong> dividend yield is higher than those of <strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong>. While telecoms have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, there are other options, such as banks, industrials and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Check out IBD's &nbsp;Income Investor &nbsp;for high-dividend-paying stocks. <strong>Cisco</strong> has been shifting to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers. Cisco in January said it would acquire software provider <strong>AppDynamics</strong> for $3.7 billion. "Wireless, security, collaboration and now ELAs (enterprise licensing agreements) helped drive 51% growth in deferred revenue from software and subscriptions to $4 billion," said Alex Kurtz, a Pacific Crest analyst, in a research report. "This was a key data point highlighting the transformation in the business model. Security was another bright spot, with 45% deferred revenue growth year-over-year." "We see the market pricing in some net benefit from a tax repatriation this year that could enable <strong>Cisco</strong> to accelerate its M A roadmap and boost its longer-term product growth rates," added Kurtz. For fiscal Q2, <strong>Cisco</strong> said it earned 57 cents per share minus items, flat from the year-earlier period but topping views by a penny. Revenue fell 2% to $11.58 billion, but that beat expectations of $11.55 billion. In the current quarter, <strong>Cisco</strong> forecast EPS of 58 cents, in line with consensus estimates, and a 1% revenue drop at the midpoint of its guidance to roughly $11.78 billion. Analysts had projected $11.86 billion in revenue. Cisco hiked its quarterly dividend by 12% to 29 cents.
