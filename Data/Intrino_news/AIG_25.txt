The pullback was modest in scope, leaving the S P 500 and the Nasdaq lower by 0.2% while the Dow (unch) resisted, eking out a slight gain. The Treasury market, which had posted six consecutive losses coming into Thursday, also reversed its recent ways. Treasuries finished higher across the board with shorter-dated issues showing relative strength in a yield-curve steepening trade. The benchmark 10-yr yield closed five basis points lower at 2.45% while the 2-yr yield finished lower by seven basis points at 1.20%. The recent losing streak aside, the Treasuries' uptick was somewhat surprising given today's strong economic data; Housing Starts (1246K; Briefing.com consensus 1220K), Initial Claims (239K; Briefing.com consensus 245K), and the Philadelphia Fed Index (43.3; Briefing.com consensus 17.5) all surpassed estimates. However, the hotter than expected readings turned out to be a non-event, at least for now, considering the market's updated rate hike expectations. The fed funds futures market is once again pointing to June as the most likely time for the next hike to be announced. The implied probability of a June hike sits at 73.9%, down from yesterday's 76.2% while the implied likelihood of a hike in May is down to 47.1%. Earnings news was relatively quiet today as nearly 80.0% of S P 500 components have already reported their results. However, Cisco Systems (CSCO 33.60, +0.78) did make a splash with its latest report. CSCO shares jumped 2.4% after the company raised its dividend and reported better than expected earnings. Cisco's upbeat performance supported a modest gain in the technology sector (+0.2%), which finished with industrials (unch) as the only cyclical spaces to close in the green. Utilities (+1.0%) closed at the top of the leaderboard, thanks to the downtick in Treasury yields and a positive reaction to Duke Energy's (DUK 78.90, +2.12) latest earnings report. Shares of DUK climbed 2.8% despite the company's earnings per share miss. Real estate (+0.4%), telecom services (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) also finished higher, while health care (-0.1%) could not keep up with its countercyclical peers. The remaining sectors-financials, consumer discretionary, materials, and energy-finished with losses between 0.1% (materials) and 1.4% (energy). The energy space's slip came despite crude oil's 0.6% advance. The commodity closed at $53.41/bbl after news that OPEC is mulling a production cut extension could potentially cut more than previously expected.

Love, M.D., president and chief executive officer of GBT. "We believe GBT440 has promising applications in hypoxemic pulmonary conditions because of its potential to enable increased oxygen uptake in the lungs and improve oxygen saturation, which in turn improves oxygen delivery to tissues.

The S P 500 and the Nasdaq are down 0.2%, while the Dow (-0.1%) holds a slight advantage. Similarly, the Treasury market has reversed its recent ways in today's session. Treasuries show gains across the board after finishing lower in six straight sessions. The benchmark 10-yr yield hovers four basis points lower at 2.45%. While unsurprising given the recent bullish sentiment, today's pullback didn't look so obvious following this morning's wave of economic data. Housing starts (1246K; Briefing.com consensus 1220K), Initial Claims (239K; Briefing.com consensus 245K), and the Philadelphia Fed Index (43.3; Briefing.com consensus 17.5) all surpassed estimates, pointing to continued economic growth. On the whole, cyclical groups have fared worse than their countercyclical counterparts, but the top-weighted technology sector (unch) trades a bit ahead of the market while health care (-0.3%) lags. The top-weighted tech space has profited from Cisco System's (CSCO 33.78, +0.97) better than expected earnings report and news of a dividend boost. Health care's downtick has been influenced by a bearish sentiment in the biotechnology industry, evidenced by the 0.8% decrease in the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 292.58, -2.37). To be fair, today's slide from the IBB follows a huge 10.3% gain in 2017, so some backtracking is not a big surprise. Crude oil has had a fairly volatile session, bouncing back and forth between green and red as investors weigh an uptick in U.S. drilling against reports indicating that OPEC may extend its oil supply cut agreement with non-members or seek further reductions. The commodity is currently up 0.8% at $53.54/bbl while the energy space (-0.8%) remains in the red. Today's economic data included January Housing Starts, Initial Claims, and the Philadelphia Fed Index for February: Investors will not receive any more economic data on Thursday. 1:01 pm Allianz SE reports Q4 results; announces EUR 3 bln share repurchase program ( AZSEY ) : 1:00 pm Earnings Calendar for Thursday, February 16th (:SUMRX) : 12:48 pm Plug Power announces it has executed on an awarded contract from The United States Postal Service by deploying 36 GenDrive hydrogen fuel cell units for class 1 sit-down counterbalance trucks and 49 GenDrive hydrogen fuel cell units for class-3 pallet jacks in their material handling fleet ( PLUG ) : The hydrogen fuel cell-powered fleet in Capital Heights, Maryland is now operational, having gone live today during a grand opening hosted by USPS.
