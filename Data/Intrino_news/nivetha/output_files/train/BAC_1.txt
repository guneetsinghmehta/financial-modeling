<strong>Bank of America</strong> ( BAC ) and <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> ( WFC ) have repeatedly discussed the importance of cost controls and how such measures could significantly boost the banks ( XLF ) earnings over the next few years. Banks ( JPM ) have been forced to realign their cost structures, which could enable them to remain profitable, contain rising costs in a volatile environment, and offset the impact of low interest rates. Since the 2008 financial crisis, <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> and <strong>Bank of America</strong> have been focusing extensively on expense control mechanisms. During the 2Q16 earnings call, <strong>Bank of America</strong>s CEO, Brian Moynihan, stated that the new expense target for fiscal 2018 would be $53 billion. <strong>Bank of America</strong> has cut nearly $8 billion in expenses through two initiativesits cost-cutting project, New BAC, and its efficiency program, Simplify and Improve. In 4Q16, <strong>Bank of America</strong> had an efficiency ratio of 65.1% while <strong>Wells Fargos</strong> efficiency ratio was 61.2%. Although this is a significant improvement from its 88% efficiency ratio in 2014, there is still considerable room for <strong>Bank of America</strong> to improve by implementing further cost-cutting initiatives or by increasing revenues. During 4Q16, <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> ( WFC ) had higher professional services and legal expenses that related to its fake account scandal. As part of its cost-cutting measures, <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> plans to shut down 200 branches in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In 2016, the bank closed down 84 branches. Quote data by Xignite
