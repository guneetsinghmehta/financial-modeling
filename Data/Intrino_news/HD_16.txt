Research firm  IHS Markit  expects some very large, prominent companies   including Coca-Cola and Home Depot to hike their dividends next week. Below are the four, from biggest potential increase to smallest, plus a few lines of Markit s commentary: Home Depot ( HD ) is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 14.5% to 79 cents a share. Analyst Kun Pu writes: As the whole US housing market is resuming its vigour, with the Case Shriller index reaching just 3% below its peak in 2007, Home Depot is well positioned to benefit as the industry leader. Management recently guided its revenue growth of 4-5% and operating margin to improve 120bps in FY2018. As such, we maintain an optimistic outlook for a dividend jump on the way. Kohl s Corporation ( KSS ) is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 10% to 55 cents a share. Analyst Roberto Soares writes: This represents a payout ratio in terms of consensus estimated EPS of approximately 58%, in line with its current dividend payout range of 55%-60%. As management reaffirmed its commitment to return value to shareholders by increasing share repurchase authorization, KSS is planning a buyback of $1bn, similar to the buybacks of $1.2bn and $2.3bn in the previous two years. Waste Management ( WM ) is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 6.7% to 43.75 cents a share. Analyst Santiago Mendez writes: Fundamentals are expected to improve compared to last year: earnings are expected to increase by around 15% in FY16, compared to a 5% last year, cash from operations is expected to rise by 20% and leverage is expected to decrease by around 10%. This would make the company more likely to increase its dividend by a larger percentage than the 3% pattern it has been following for the last four years. Coca-Cola Company ( KO ) is expected to hike its quarterly dividend 5.7% to 37 cents a share. Soares writes: KO s payout has increased to a high 60% of cash from operations as of lately, compared to historical payout in the low 50%. The uptick in payout primarily results from revenue decline, currency headwinds and structural changes  We expect KO to be a little more conservative with future dividend increases, and we expect a slight increase of 5.7% to $0.37/qtr.
