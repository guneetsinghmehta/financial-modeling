<p>This might sound a little odd, but my favorite gadget of this young year is a laptop power adapter. See, it&rsquo;s no secret that I&rsquo;m rabid USB-C nut . Imagine: You&rsquo;ll soon have one power cord for every device (laptop, desktop, phone, tablet) from every manufacturer. A genuine universal power cord. There&rsquo;s no upside-down way to insert a USB-C connector, and there&rsquo;s no wrong end on the cord. The wattage auto-adjusts to whatever you&rsquo;re charging. And the same cable carries not just power, but also video, audio, and data! It&rsquo;s just crazy brilliant. ( Here&rsquo;s my interview with the guy who spent three years with 600 electronics companies designing it.) USB-C is already on laptops from <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ), <strong>HP</strong> ( HPQ ), <strong>Razer</strong>, <strong>Google</strong> ( GOOG , GOOGL ), <strong>Microsoft</strong> ( MSFT ), <strong>Dell</strong>, <strong>Asus</strong>, <strong>Lenovo</strong> and others . And it&rsquo;s already the charging jack on phones from <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Motorola</strong> ( MSI ), <strong>Samsung</strong>, <strong>LG</strong>, <strong>Huawei</strong>, <strong>OnePlus</strong>, <strong>LeEco</strong>, and many others . Rumor is that the iPhone 8 and Galaxy 8 phones will both use USB-C as well. As I&rsquo;ve written, the switch to USB-C currently involves adapters and replacement cables. But in the long term, it means we&rsquo;ll no longer have drawers like these: It also means that we can carry just one charger for all our stuff. Since I&rsquo;ve been learning to love the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, this is a big deal: Finding a smaller, nicer charger to replace the big white plastic 3-prong Apple one would make a huge difference to my bag&rsquo;s travel weight. And so I found this: The Dart-C, billed as the world&rsquo;s smallest laptop charger. And it really is tiny. Yet somehow, it provides 65 watts&mdash;plenty for laptops like the 12- and 13-inch MacBooks, the <strong>Lenovo</strong> ThinkPad 13, ASUS ZenBook 3, Dell XPS 13, and so on. Really honking laptops, like the 15-inch MacBook Pro, expect more wattage (85). This charger will work on those machines&mdash;just not as fast. How do I love this thing? Let us count the ways. I keep one laptop charger my laptop bag, and one plugged in by the couch. So I&rsquo;ve been through the mill, trying to find just the right charging cord to be my spare. Since USB-C means that I&rsquo;m no longer locked into Apple&rsquo;s proprietary chargers, I&rsquo;ve experimented with a Dell ($27, 30 watts) and a Udoli ($35, 45 watts), shown below. I knew both would take longer to charge than my MacBook Pro&rsquo;s original charger (61 watts), but that didn&rsquo;t really matter for hotel-room purposes; they&rsquo;d have overnight to charge. What I found, though, was that the <strong>Dell</strong> makes my laptop chime every few seconds, as though the cord is being unplugged and replugged. (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably not &lsquo;to spec,&rsquo;&rdquo; a buddy of mine guesses&mdash;a hazard of the new, open USB-C world.) The Udoli works fine as long as the laptop is open &mdash; but when closed, it occasionally does that same chime. (I asked Anthony Sagneri, chief technology officer of FINsix, the Dart&rsquo;s maker, about this chiming business. His suspicion: &ldquo;The Intel chipsets inside most laptops can draw large peak currents for short periods. But if the charger isn&rsquo;t designed for those surges, they can trip its overcurrent mode, cutting power; at that point, the charger re-negotiates its connection.&rdquo; In other words&mdash;ding!) But the Dart? No problems. It&rsquo;s small, gorgeous, lightweight (3 ounces!), fast, and chime-free. There are some footnotes. First, the prongs don&rsquo;t fold up, as they do on some chargers. And the Dart-C is back-ordered; the company says it has begun shipping, but new orders won&rsquo;t ship until next month. (It&rsquo;s worth noting that the actual Dart-C&mdash;the &ldquo;brick&rdquo; itself&mdash;is identical to the original Dart charger, as first seen on <strong>Kickstarter</strong>. All that&rsquo;s new is the USB-C cable that plugs into it, which contains all the USB-C electronics and smarts. In fact, if you bought the original Dart&mdash;the one that comes with plug tips for a wide range of laptop models&mdash;you can get just the USB-C cable for it for $35.) Second, this charger costs $100, which is even more than Apple&rsquo;s chargers ($70 and $80). That&rsquo;s a drag. I&rsquo;m confident that in the new, open world of USB-C chargers, we&rsquo;ll have more compact, attractive, well-engineered options. For now, though, since this will be my one and only charger for all my gadgets, and since I travel a lot, and since space and weight are valued commodities in my laptop bag, I&rsquo;m going to bite the bullet. I have no problem saying it: The smallest laptop charger in the world is also one of the best. If you&rsquo;re a rabid USB-C nut like me, you&rsquo;ll be in heaven.
