Heading into its earnings following the close of trading yesterday, shares of American International Group ( AIG ) had gained 34% from its low on Jun. 28 to Feb. 14. Then the bottom fell out. AIG reported a loss of $2.96 a share , missing forecasts for a profit of $1.16 a share, due in large part to a $5.6 billion reserve charge. Analysts had been expecting about $3.5 billion. Now American International Group is off 9.1% at $60.79 at 1:08 p.m. today. Barclays analyst Jay Gelb and team contend that the future depends on the ratings agencies: AIG sized its previously announced 4Q loss reserve charge: $5.6bn pre-tax. This charge was significant and much larger than our estimate of around $3bn. If A.M Best affirms its financial strength rating of AIG of ‘A’, we believe it would remove a negative overhang on AIG shares. If, however, AIG were downgraded by A.M. Best (to A-), we think it could result in slowing or ceasing share buybacks to conserve capital. In a more pessimistic scenario, AIG could require a dilutive capital raise or exit of business units. Separately, S P said [last night] it would take no immediate rating action on AIG . Stay tuned. Error message Be the first to leave a comment on this blog.
