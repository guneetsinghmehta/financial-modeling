Earlier in this series, we discussed how LifeLocks acquisition could enhance <strong>Symantecs</strong> ( SYMC ) growth prospects. Lets explore the role of hedge fund management company<strong> Elliott Management</strong>. The tech sector seems to be <strong>Elliott Managements</strong> strength. In <strong>Elliott Managements</strong> words, Within the technology sector, we have made approximately three dozen active investments and have successfully identified value-creating opportunities at companies, listing <strong>Citrix Systems</strong> (CTRX), <strong>Informatica</strong>, <strong>Brocade Communications Systems</strong> ( BRCD ), <strong>Riverbed Technology</strong> ( RVBD ), <strong>Juniper Networks</strong> ( JNPR ), and<strong> Blue Coat Systems</strong> as examples. <strong>Elliott Management</strong> has had a considerable influence over the <strong>Dell</strong>-<strong>EMC</strong> ( EMC ) deal, which is the biggest acquisition to date in the technology space. <strong>Elliott Management</strong>s strategies usually revolve around taking a stake in a company and then devising ways to maximize shareholder returns. The majority of these companies find it difficult to report revenue growth that impacts their profitability and stock prices.<strong> Elliott Management</strong> usually exerts considerable pressure on the companies either to change their capital structure or strategy, spin off, or sell to a private equity firm. <strong>Elliott Management</strong> took on a substantial stake in <strong>Symantec</strong> in February 2016. Considering the hedge funds past success in the tech space, Symantecs stock surged by ~9% on the news. <strong>Elliott Management</strong> urged <strong>Symantec</strong> to explore its options. As a result, <strong>Symantec</strong> announced the acquisition of <strong>Blue Coat Systems</strong> in June 2016, its largest acquisition in more than a decade. Earlier, we highlighted that Elliott has a stake in Blue Coat. Therefore, strategically, <strong>Elliott Management</strong> spurred the sale of <strong>Blue Coat</strong> to <strong>Symantec</strong> , thereby strengthening and expanding its <strong>Enterprise Security</strong> segments offerings and presence in the cybersecurity space. It then influenced <strong>Symantec</strong> to consider a strategic acquisition to boost its personal computerdependent Consumer Security segment. The result was <strong>LifeLocks</strong> buyout by <strong>Symantec</strong>. The above presentation shows that most of<strong> Elliott Managements</strong> software targets have ended up being bought at attractive prices. Later in this series, well discuss how <strong>LifeLocks</strong> sale benefited <strong>Elliott Management</strong>. Quote data by <strong>Xignite</strong>
