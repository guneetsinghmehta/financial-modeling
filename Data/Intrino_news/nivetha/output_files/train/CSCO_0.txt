Shares of networker<strong> Arista Networks</strong> ( ANET ) are up $17.04, or 17%, at $117.21, and price targets at several shops are zooming higher in response, after the company yesterday afternoon reported Q4 revenue that topped analysts expectations, and beat on the bottom line by a wide margin, and also handily topped revenue consensus for this quarter. On a conference call with analysts following the report, CEO Jayshree Ullal noted that cloud computing shops ( <strong>Microsoft</strong> s ( MSFT ) Azure computing facility is one of the companys largest customers) continue to spend on the companys equipment. She noted in particular rising interest in the companys Series R products that do not only switching tasks, but also move into <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> s ( CSCO ) routing franchise. Ullal also noted the companys legal battle with <strong>Cisco</strong>, saying the company had made progress in assembling equipment upon which an import ban had been levied. She did not speculate on the ultimate outcome of <strong>Ciscos</strong> remaining claims against <strong>Arista</strong>, but did note that four of the five remaining patents primarily cover commonly standard implemented networking features used across the switching industry such as private VLANs, access list and CoPP. Analysts today are particularly impressed the companys gross profit margin remained steady at 64.4% despite having to shift some manufacturing to the U.S. The only issue for the bears is the valuation , which they think bakes in all the earnings upside at this point. BMO Capital s Tim Long reiterates an Outperform rating, and raises his price target to $130 from $100, writing that the momentum in Aristas business is impressive. Despite the distraction of litigation, demand is very healthy and the company continues to take share in the data center switching market. All of <strong>Aristas</strong> major verticals are growing well, highlighted by cloud titans benefiting from 80% Y/Y growth at <strong>Microsoft</strong> in 2016. We see considerable runway for future growth and share gains, as the company leverages partnerships, expands globally, and addresses new opportunities with new products. <strong>Pacific Crest s</strong> Alex Kurtz reiterates an Overweight rating, and raise his price target to $121 from $100, writing <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Arista</strong> s 7500/7200R hybrid router series and <strong>Arista</strong> s broader software suite, like CloudVision, remain key upside levers. We would note that Microsoft has six new regions planned for C2017 vs. eight in C2016, and management expects a strong finish to Microsoft s fiscal year-end in C2Q/3Q, a good thing for the company. From the bear camp, James Faucette with <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> , who has an Equal Weight rating on the shares, labels the report Momentum Majesty. We believe <strong>Aristas</strong> compelling momentum is well reflected in current val., writes Faucette, who has a $94 price target, even as its unique products, management team and operations cant be overlooked. The stocks success in the Cloud Titans will support a long-term earnings power of ~$6.00, but it is likely well reflected in current stock prices. Regarding valuation, Faucette writes, We value peak earnings at 18-19x discounted back to allow for potential growth beyond $6.00 EPS as <strong>Arista</strong> introduces new data center products. We would become more positive on the stock if the company gains faster than expected traction in switch-router use cases or the opportunity proves to be a demonstrably larger market than we are currently anticipating.
