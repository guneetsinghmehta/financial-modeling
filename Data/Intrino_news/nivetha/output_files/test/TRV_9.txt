The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique inside view into the business, so when these insiders make purchases, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason for a company insider to choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. Within the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only nine companies have experienced such buying over the trailing six month period, one of which was <strong>Travelers Companies Inc</strong> (Symbol: TRV), where an investment totaling $214.4K was made by Director Philip T.
