<strong>Snapchat</strong> disclosed in its IPO (initial public offering) filing that it has a signed deal to use <strong>Alphabet</strong>s ( GOOGL ) <strong>Google</strong> Cloud for five years. Thats a boost to <strong>Alphabet</strong>s cloud business and a setback for cloud computing leaders <strong>Amazon</strong> ( AMZN ) and <strong>Microsoft</strong> ( MSFT ). The filing notes that Snap, which owns mobile messaging app <strong>Snapchat</strong>, would pay $400 million per year to <strong>Google</strong> Cloud, bringing the cost of using the cloud for five years to $2 billion. Gartner estimates that $216 billion would be spent on public cloud services in 2020, up from $114 billion in 2016. <strong>Alphabet</strong> ( GOOGL ) declined to disclose its cloud relationship with Snap when it recently reported its 4Q16 earnings. However, Snaps disclosure suggests that <strong>Alphabet</strong> is quietly gaining significant ground in the cloud space and that <strong>Google</strong> Cloud could be bigger than it seems. Since hiring <strong>VMware</strong>s ( VMW ) co-founder, Diane Greene, to run its Cloud Computing business, <strong>Alphabet</strong> has become more aggressive in pursuing cloud deals with its enterprise customers. Business Insider reported last year that under Greene, <strong>Google</strong> Cloud managed to steal a share of <strong>Apple</strong>s ( AAPL ) cloud operation from AWS (<strong>Amazon</strong> Web Services). In a move that could also shake <strong>Microsoft</strong>s Azure cloud, <strong>Alphabet</strong> recently announced extensions that simplify running Windows software on its cloud platform. The move signals a desire by <strong>Alphabet</strong> to entice<strong> Microsoft</strong> customers who would naturally choose Azure to use its cloud service. Cloud computing is one of Alphabets nonadvertising businesses. Advertising comprised 85.9% of <strong>Alphabet</strong>s total revenues in 4Q16, down from 89.4% in 4Q15.
