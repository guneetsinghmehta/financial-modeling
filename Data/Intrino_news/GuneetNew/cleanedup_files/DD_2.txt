On February 13, 2017, <strong>DuPont</strong> ( DD ) reached an agreement to a settlement involving ~3,500 lawsuits related to PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and its salts. Injuries had been reported due to environmental releases of PFOA from facilities in West Virginia. <strong>DuPont</strong> agreed to a settlement amount of $670.7 million in cash50% will be paid by <strong>Chemours</strong> ( CC ). The good thing for <strong>DuPont</strong> is that its getting rid of the litigation. <strong>DuPont</strong> and <strong>Chemours</strong> reached an agreement about possible litigation that could arise in the future. For the next five years, <strong>Chemours</strong> will pay for $25 million in PFOA liabilities annually. <strong>DuPont</strong> will pay for the next $25 million in liabilities. After five years, <strong>DuPont</strong> wont have a commitment towards PFOA liability that could arise. However, the liability would continue for <strong>Chemours</strong>. After five years, <strong>Chemours</strong> wont ask <strong>DuPont</strong> for any funds related to PFOA liability. As of December 31, 2016, <strong>DuPont</strong> accumulated $117 million related to PFOA. As we mentioned above, the liability of $670.7 million is split between <strong>Chemours</strong> and <strong>DuPont</strong>. As a result, <strong>DuPont</strong> will have to bear $335.35 million. With only $117 million accumulated, <strong>DuPont</strong> has to fund another $218.35 million. It could impact <strong>DuPonts</strong> future earnings, although it isnt clear when <strong>DuPont</strong> will show these charges in its books.
