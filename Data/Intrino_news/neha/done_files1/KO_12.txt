Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ: SODA ) popped nearly 6 percent Wednesday after management reported fourth-quarter sales 5 percent above estimates. This marks SodaStream’s fifth consecutive positive quarter. The company has been on a 300-percent run since February 2016, when it saw long-awaited relief from a three-year, 80-percent slide. Trader Dennis Dick offered one theory justifying the sharp shift. “When it’s straight up like that, from $25 for the last three months, you start to wonder if it’s not just a bit of a short squeeze,” Dick said on Benzinga’s PreMarket Prep radio show. He added, “Long term, I don’t get this story. It’s just not for me.” It seems he’s not alone in his disinterest. Few analysts seem to have taken notice of SodaStream’s abrupt turnaround. In fact, since the first earnings beat was reported in February 2016, only Roth Capital and Jeffries have issued ratings . Roth Capital responded to strong 2015 holiday figures with a Buy, but it downgraded SodaStream to Neutral following second-quarter results. Jeffries maintains a Hold rating on four occasions with three price target increases. Prior to that, Susquehanna reacted to positive guidance in October 2015 by downgrading to Neutral with a $16 price target. Shares are now trading above $50.
