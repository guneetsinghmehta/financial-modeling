Commodity prices have been strong over the last couple of months. This has prompted some of the metals and mining companies ( CENX ) to rethink their business strategies. Hardly a year ago, miners were mainly focused on cutting their debt levels and funding their near-term debt maturities. Growth was not exactly high on mining executives’ agendas. However, as commodity prices have improved, mining companies are looking to generate free cash flows in 2017. In this article, we’ll analyze how Alcoa ( AA ) wants to utilize its cash under the current market scenario. Alcoa ( AA ) generated $200 million in cash in November and December 2016. The company could generate positive free cash flows in 2017 looking at the current pricing environment. During the 4Q16 earnings call, Alcoa’s management listed several priorities in deploying its cash. The company could consider funding its pension and OPEB (other post-employment benefits) obligations that are currently underfunded by $3.1 billion. Alcoa could also look at deleveraging its balance sheet. The company could look at growth projects, especially in the bauxite business ( RIO ) ( NHYDY ), to enhance shareholder value. Alcoa upwardly revised its 2017 capital expenditure guidance. The company noted that it plans to spend $150 million toward “return-seeking projects.” Alcoa’s comfortable leverage ratios, coupled with the expected uptick in earnings, provides the company with optionality in utilizing its excess cash.  Meanwhile, it would be interesting to see how the market ( DIA ) ( DOW ) is valuing Alcoa amid the current market scenario. In the final part of this series, we’ll look at Alcoa’s valuation multiples. Quote data by Xignite
