InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice Trading Tips Monday was a strong day for U.S. stocks, led by financials with a 1.1% push. The&nbsp; S P 500 Index and the&nbsp; Nasdaq Composite surged 0.5% apiece, while the&nbsp; Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%. Tuesday's trade should again be dominated by earnings, with <strong>Arch Capital Group Ltd.</strong> (NASDAQ: ACGL ) and <strong>OneMain Holdings Inc</strong> (NYSE: OMF ) among companies doling out their latest quarterly reports. However, <strong>General Motors Company</strong> (NYSE: GM ) is making hay on some M A chatter. Here's what you should know: GM shares were up strongly on Tuesday morning on news that French carmarker PSA is considering buying out the American automaker's Peugeot division. A company spokesperson confirmed that PSA "is exploring a number of strategic initiatives with GM with the aim of increasing its profitability and operating efficiency, including a potential acquisition of <strong>Opel</strong>." If PSA is successful, it likely would become Europe's No. 2 automaker behind <strong>Volkswagen</strong> (OTCMKTS: VLKAY ). The deal is being very well-received by GM shareholders amid a lackluster year in which <strong>General Motors</strong> is underperforming the market, thanks in part to an earnings report that showed GM's European business lost money for the 16th straight year. GM stock was up more than 3% in early Tuesday trade. OMF shares were surging on Tuesday thanks to a positive fourth quarter . Earnings came in at 80 cents per share, which did miss the consensus estimate by a penny. However, the figure was significantly better than the 66 cents it posted in the year-ago quarter. Before considering taxes, earnings in the Consumer and Insurance segment were $175 million on an adjusted basis. The number was $33 million better year-over-year.&nbsp;Real Estate adjusted pretax losses also thinned out, from $34 million last year to $7 million in Q4 2016. For the full fiscal year, the company earned $1.59 per diluted share, handily topping the $1.72 per share loss from the prior year. OMF stock started Tuesday up 9%. <strong>Arch Capital Group</strong> reported strong earnings late Monday, but ACGL wasn't quick to respond. The company managed to bring in 50 cents over the holiday period, which amounted to $1.13 per share when&nbsp;adjusted for one-time gains and costs. Analysts were expecting non-GAAP earnings of $1.01 per share. <strong>Arch Capital</strong> also posted revenue that topped expectations at&nbsp;$966.5 million in the period. A few other highlights from the report included 8.3% growth in gross premiums written, and 4.5% improvement in net investment income. Underwriting leaped by nearly 140% to $42.3 million. The mortgage segment was particularly strong, too, with gross premiums written here jumping just more than 50.7% to $138.3 million. Nonetheless, ACGL stock was trading flat in early Tuesday trade.
