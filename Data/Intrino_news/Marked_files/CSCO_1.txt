BREAKING: Dow, S P 500 Stay Down; Nasdaq Inches Into Positive Ground Need to register? Current subscribers register here . Arista Networks hit a record high after it posted a Q4 beat, but it remains in litigation with rival <strong>Cisco Systems.</strong> (Arista)<strong> Arista Networks</strong> ( ANET ), a fierce rival of <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> ( CSCO ), won price-target hikes from a number of investment banks in the wake of its Q4 earnings and revenue beat late Thursday, but <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> is sticking with a sell rating. <strong>Arista Networks</strong> stock popped 17% to a record high above 117 in early trading in the stock market today . Arista made its IPO in June 2014 at 43 a share. <strong>Cisco</strong> stock, trading near nine-year highs, was down a fraction early Friday. Q4 earnings per share ex items jumped 30% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.04, while revenue rose 34% to $328 million. Analysts had projected 82 cents and $315.2 million. Strong demand from <strong>Microsoft</strong> ( MSFT ) boosted Arista's Q4 earnings as it navigates a legal battle with <strong>Cisco</strong>, analysts said. Arista sells network switches that speed up communications in cloud-computing data centers. Besides <strong>Microsoft</strong>, Arista's customers include <strong>Amazon</strong>.com ( AMZN ) and <strong>Facebook</strong> ( FB ). IBD'S TAKE: <strong> Arista Networks</strong> in January dropped out of the IBD 50 , a list of fast-growing companies. <strong>Nvidia</strong> still tops the IBD 50, which also includes Applied Materials, <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>NetEase</strong>. Amid the legal battle with rival <strong>Cisco</strong>, <strong>Arista Networks</strong> has rushed to ramp up U.S. manufacturing in case its imports are blocked. <strong>Arista Networks</strong> has also stocked up on materials and components from Asian suppliers, analysts say. Jefferies on Friday upgraded <strong>Arista Networks</strong> to hold from underperform. "We now believe that  in the highest-probability scenario  Arista's legal problems won't affect their core business in any significant way," said Jefferies analyst George Notter in a research report. Pacific Crest Securities hiked its price target on Arista stock to 121 from 100. <strong>Needham Co.</strong> increased its PT to 130 from 110.<strong> RBC Capital</strong> hiked it to 115 from 105. <strong>BMO Capital Markets</strong> upped it to 130 from 110, while Instinet's PT climbed to 125 from 110. "Despite <strong>Cisco's</strong> best efforts, Arista has successfully navigated a storm of patent litigation and we believe is poised to emerge with its ability to capture <strong>Cisco</strong> market share intact," said Mark Kelleher, a DA Davidson analyst, in a report. The International Trade Commission has slated a hearing in April related to the <strong>Cisco</strong>-<strong>Arista Networ</strong>k patent litigation. Arista Networks has denied infringing <strong>Cisco's</strong> patents, and it also says it has modified its network software to resolve issues. Simona Jankowski, a <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> analyst who maintains a sell rating on <strong>Arista</strong>, cautioned that its Q4 beat came from <strong>Microsoft</strong> "pulling forward demand into 2016 to ensure adequate supply" of network switches. For the current quarter, Arista forecast revenue of $325 million at the midpoint of its guidance vs. consensus estimates of $304.8 million. "We give credit to <strong>Arista's</strong> strong product portfolio and customer relationships, as well as management's solid execution, for the continued beat-and-raise performance of the company in the face of multiple legal challenges in the two-year-long litigation battle with <strong>Cisco</strong>," added Jankowski. "We continue to view this as a risky period of execution for the company and for investors, and one that does not appear fully discounted in the stocks' premium valuation." In 2017, <strong>Arista Networks</strong> is expected to begin to increasingly rely on a U.S. supply chain, weighing on profit margins.
