Darren Woodson and Jeff Saturday break down their 2016 postseason teams that won't repeat in 2017, as well as teams that missed the playoffs that will get there next season. (1:55) Will the New England Patriots be back in next year's Super Bowl, trying to get their sixth championship? What about the Atlanta Falcons ? Don't count out the Pittsburgh Steelers , Seattle Seahawks or Green Bay Packers . Or maybe it's time for the Dallas Cowboys , Oakland Raiders , New York Giants or Kansas City Chiefs to make an appearance.

There was no favorite in the AFC, but an NFC team got 60 percent of the votes. Check out the results below, along with quotes from each executive.
