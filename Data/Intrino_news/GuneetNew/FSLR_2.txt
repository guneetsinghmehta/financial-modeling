<p>Solar energy leader <strong>First Solar Inc.</strong> ( FSLR ) is slated to report its full-year 2016 and fourth-quarter results on Feb. 21 after market close. The Tempe, Ariz.-based renewable energy provider disappointed investors in the previous quarter after posting mixed third-quarter results and slashing FY â€‹16 guidance down by $1 billion due to an announced restructuring . Management defended the costly restructuring as a necessary step in order to streamline a more cost-efficient solar model in light of declining solar panel prices. <strong>First Solar</strong> indicates the plans will help the firm stay ahead of the long-term growth industry and ensure the company will be able to reinvest in its business later on. For the full-year period ended Dec. 31, First Solar expects $2.85 billion in sales at the midpoint, compared to the Street&rsquo;s projected $2.88 billion and last year&rsquo;s reported $3.58 billion in sales. The Street predicts FY16 earnings of $4.70 per share, reflecting a 14% decline year-over-year (YOY) . In the fourth quarter, analysts on average foresee the company to post adjusted earnings of $0.96 on a per-share basis, down from year-ago non-GAAP EPS of $1.60. The Street expects <strong>First Solar&rsquo;s</strong> sales to come in at $412.8 million, indicating an estimated 56.2% decline from sales of $942.3 million over the same period last year. Shares of <strong>First Solar</strong>, trading down about 1.8% a price of $34.10 per share on Thursday afternoon, represent an approximate 46% decline YOY. Despite a short-term shock to <strong>First Solar&rsquo;s</strong> stock, caused by the surprise election of President Donald Trump (an avowed climate-change skeptic), low oil prices and overall uncertainty, First Solar bulls are confident in a responsible restructuring aimed to release a more cost-competitive product. At the head of its peers, the Arizona firm is positioned to benefit from a global shift to alternative energy solutions. As solar companies win major contracts and beat out traditional energy providers, solar is estimated to make up a majority of worldwide energy production by 2050.
