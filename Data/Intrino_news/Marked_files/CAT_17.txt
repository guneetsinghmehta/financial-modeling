Published: Feb 14, 2017 4:35 p.m. ET Financial sector has rallied more than 20% since election By U.S. stocks notched a fourth straight record close Tuesday with a rally in banks after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen signaled that the central bank could gradually raise interest rates sooner rather than later. During Yellens testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, stocks flipped between small gains and losses but started carving out fresh intraday highs as the testimony wrapped up, adding to three straight days of record closes for the Dow industrials, S P 500 and the Nasdaq. The S P 500 index SPX, -0.18% finished up 9.33 points, or 0.4%, at a record 2,337.58, with financials and health-care stocks leading the gains. The financials sector has rallied more than 20% since the November election, and 4.2% this month alone. Bank stocks jumped after Yellens comments on interest rates, while rate-sensitive sectors such as utilities and real estate slumped. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.30% gained 92.25 points, or 0.5%, to close at a record 20,504.41, with 23 of the 30 blue-chip components trading higher. Shares of <strong>Goldman Sachs Group Inc</strong> GS, +0.12% closed at a record $249.92, with a 1.3% gain. <strong>J.P. Morgan Chase Co</strong> JPM, -0.34% led gainers with a 1.6% rise. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.06% rose 18.62 points, or 0.3%, to close at a record 5,782.57. Some market participants read Yellens reference to the Fed raising rates at upcoming meetings as indicating that an increase of benchmark rates at the Feds March meeting, which Wall Street has been pricing in as unlikely, is still on the table. Central bank officials last lifted the Fed-funds rate in December to a range between 0.50% and 0.75%. It appears that [Yellen] is priming the market to expect two or three rate hikes, which has been reflected in higher moves in financials and bond yields, said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at <strong>RBC Global Asset Management.</strong> Larson also noted the Fed has some degree of hesitation regarding what the fiscal stimulus will look like.

The Fed is going to be reactive [rather] than proactive, so we dont expect the first rate hike this year until May or June, said Wouter Sturkenboom, senior investment strategist at Russell Investments. Fed member forecasts for rates suggest that the central bank will raise rates three times in 2017, but the market isnt expecting an increase before the Federal Open Market Committees June meeting, according to CME Group data . While Yellens testimony didn't detract from earlier statements from the central bank, the door is still open for a March rate hike to stick to the Feds target of three increases this year, said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, in an interview. There was a little shift that there could be one in March, Kepner said. The market is not strongly considering it, but expectations have nudged up a little bit. The Fed originally said three [rate hikes] so March could be a swing month, but you still have economic numbers and the jobs report and maybe some clarification on tax policies before then. See : Live blog recap of Yellens testimony Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who is isnt a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, said Tuesday that almost all policy rules are recommending higher interest rates. Treasury yields, which are sensitive to shifting rate-hike expectations, jumped on Yellens comments but have walked back a bit. The 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.31% advanced 3.4 basis points to 2.469%, compared with 2.434% late Monday in New York. Bond yields rise as prices fall, and investors tend to unload bonds in a rising interest-rate environment in anticipation of being able to repurchase government bonds at higher rates in the future.
