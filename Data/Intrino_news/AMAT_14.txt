Applied Materials ( AMAT ) is seeing strong growth momentum in its Semiconductor Systems segment as the semiconductor industry undergoes a technological transition. One area where AMAT is seeing an inflection point is its display technology. The increasing adoption of OLED (organic light emitting diode) by smartphone makers is driving demand in AMAT’s Display segment. AMAT witnessed 266% sequential growth in new orders in the Display segment in fiscal 2Q16, and this momentum continued in fiscal 3Q16. The segment’s revenue almost doubled from $235 million in fiscal 4Q15 to $452 million in fiscal 4Q16 driven by strong sales of CVD (chemical vapor deposition) and edge solutions. The segment contributed 13.7% towards the company’s overall revenue in fiscal 4Q16. AMAT witnessed increasing adoption of its new solutions such as selective edge, Olympia ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition), new thin-film encapsulation, and e-beam in 2016. The company is developing new solutions to help its customers transition to new display products. For fiscal 1Q17, AMAT expects the Display segment’s revenue to fall 7.3% sequentially to $419 million. UBS analyst Stephen Chin, citing its monthly sales tracker, stated that AMAT’s monthly sales of display equipment in China ( FXI ) increased from an average of $45 million in fiscal 2016 to $150 million and $75 million in November and December 2016. He expects display sales in China to grow by 50% YoY (year-over-year) and the overall display sales to grow 65% YoY in fiscal 2017. AMAT earns 75% of its display revenue in China for LCD screens and the remaining 25% from OLED displays. However, OLED is replacing LCD in the smartphone market. IHS Markit expects the market for small-sized and medium-sized OLED panels to reach $18.6 billion in 2018, exceeding the LCD market. However, the display segment’s new orders dropped 52% sequentially to $387 million in fiscal 4Q16. According to a Bloomberg report, Canon Tokki is unable to complete its orders for OLED equipment even after the company doubled its output. The company has a two-year backlog. Almost all OLED panels are built on Canon Tokki’s equipment and a shortage of this equipment forced several AMAT customers to cancel their orders. This trend is likely to continue in fiscal 2017. Some analysts expect AMAT to lose orders of up to $1 billion in fiscal 2017 and increase competition in the encapsulation space. Canon Tokki’s supply constraints could also impact Apple’s ( AAPL ) iPhone 8. Next, we will look at other opportunities and challenges for AMAT’s display segment. Quote data by Xignite
