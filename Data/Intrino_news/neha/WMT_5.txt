<p><strong>Walmart</strong> ( WMT ) has exceeded analysts&rsquo; earnings estimates in the last five consecutive quarters. <strong>Walmart</strong> delivered adjusted EPS (earnings per share) of $0.98 in fiscal 3Q17 ahead of the consensus Wall Street analyst earnings estimate of $0.96. However, the company&rsquo;s earnings continued to fall on a year-over-year basis in fiscal 3Q17, which ended on October 31, 2016. <strong>Walmart</strong>&rsquo;s earnings have been under pressure due to currency headwinds. In fiscal 3Q17, adverse currency fluctuations dragged down the company&rsquo;s adjusted EPS by $0.03. Also, higher wages, the company&rsquo;s investments in online channels, and other growth initiatives put pressure on the bottom line.<strong> Walmart</strong>&rsquo;s gross margin improved by 34 basis points to 25.3% in fiscal 3Q17. The company attributed this improvement to higher margins in the general merchandise and consumables and food categories. Merchandise procurement savings and lower transportation expenses resulting from lower fuel costs helped to improve the US segment&rsquo;s gross margin. The company&rsquo;s 3Q17 gross margin was also favorably impacted by improved inventory management and the company&rsquo;s cost analytics program in certain markets in its International segment. Unlike its gross margin, the company&rsquo;s operating margin fell by 50 basis points to about 4.4% in fiscal 3Q17 due to higher wages and investments in digital retail and technology. In November 2016, <strong>Walmart</strong> raised the lowered end of its EPS guidance range. The company expects its fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS to be in the $4.20&ndash;$4.35 range compared to the previous guidance range of $4.15&ndash;$4.35. The company expects its fiscal 4Q17 EPS in the $1.18&ndash;$1.33 range. Analysts expect <strong>Walmart</strong>&rsquo;s fiscal 4Q17 adjusted EPS to fall 13.3% to $1.29. Analysts expect the adjusted EPS of <strong>Target</strong> ( TGT ) and <strong>Kroger</strong> ( KR ) to fall 0.8% and 8.2%, respectively, in the comparable fourth quarter.
