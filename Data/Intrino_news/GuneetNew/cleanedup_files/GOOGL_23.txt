<strong>Alphabets</strong> ( GOOGL ) push toward freedom from advertising dependency has been leading the company into massive financial losses. In 4Q16, the tech giant lost more than $1 billion in its experimental projects, including its autonomous driving unit, <strong>Waymo</strong>; its smart home division, <strong>Nest</strong>; its cable Internet business, <strong>Google</strong> Fiber; and its balloon Internet program, Project Loon. However, the good news is that its losses are narrowing. In 4Q16, the company had slightly more than $1 billion in operating losses in the Other Bets segment, which was lower than its $1.2 billion loss in 4Q15. <strong>Alphabet</strong> generated $262 million in revenues from its moonshot projects, which was over $150 million in the previous year. <strong>Alphabet</strong> ( GOOGL ) has recently made moves that could prune costs in its experimental arms. For example, separating its Autonomous Driving segment into a standalone entity called <strong>Waymo</strong> means that the business must now show value for the investment it has consumed since it was launched several years ago. <strong>Waymo</strong> executives have been put in the position where they must work harder to not only justify investment in the business, but also make the division self-sufficient. In other measures, <strong>Alphabet</strong> has either completely shut down certain moonshot programs or whittled down their workforces amid a push toward greater financial control. Looking at recent developments, <strong>Waymo</strong> is one of <strong>Alphabets</strong> moonshots that seems to be on the way to a brighter future. The California Department of Motor Vehicles recently released data showing that vehicles fitted with <strong>Waymos</strong> technology rank first with respect to accuracy and safety on the road. <strong>Waymo</strong> beat its competitors featuring vehicles powered by autonomous driving systems, including <strong>Ford</strong> (F), <strong>General Motors</strong> ( GM ), and <strong>Tesla</strong> ( TSLA ). <strong>Waymos</strong> automaker partners include<strong> Fiat Chrysler</strong> ( FCAU ), and its reaching out to other partners.
