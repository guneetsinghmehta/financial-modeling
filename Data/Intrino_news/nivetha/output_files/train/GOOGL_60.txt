James Dix of Wedbush Securities , who started coverage of <strong>Alphabet</strong> s ( GOOGL ) <strong>Google</strong> division with a dour view last September regarding its advertising prospects, today reiterates an Underperform rating on the shares, and a $700 price target, writing that a meaningful cross-section of marketers is pulling back on paid search ad spending with GOOGL, and that the company faces rising competition from <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ), <strong>Facebook</strong> ( FB ), and especially <strong>Amazon</strong> ( AMZN ). Dix makes the case competition is increasing: There are numerous scaled digital platforms that could offer ads to shoppers at the end of the purchase funnel, and who have only begun to do so: AMZN in e- commerce, AAPL in the iOS ecosystem, and FB on mobile generally. As WPPs CEO said last month, The company that would worry me if I was a clientor I think worries our clients, more than <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong>is <strong>Amazon</strong>. <strong>Amazons</strong> Echo voice-driven assistant exemplifies searchs increasing interface risk, writes Dix, which GOOGL management addresses on conference calls with early days generalities. He suggests it could be the siren song that becomes a swan song. Regarding the pull-back in marketers, Dix offers no detail but refers to the following table of data from research firms that track advertising: <strong>Alphabet</strong> shares today are up 8 cents at $840.11. Error message You would have to be nuts.. <strong>Wedbush</strong> has zero cred. None. If you want to sell GOOG, sell it because the snowflakes are living in their own alt-reality, and spending/wasting every last nickle of earnings. eff-U <strong>Google</strong> indeed, (former shareholder) Tech Trader Daily is a blog on technology investing written by <strong>Barrons</strong> veteran Tiernan Ray.
