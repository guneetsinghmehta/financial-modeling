<p><strong>Home Depot Inc</strong> (NYSE: HD ) and its closest peer <strong>Lowe's Companies, Inc.</strong> (NYSE: LOW ) are on deck to report their respective earnings results. Peter Benedict of Baird commented in a report Census data showed industry wide sales growth slowed in the quarter to 4.5 percent in November and December from 5.5 percent in the third quarter. Benedict argued this shouldn't be a surprise to investors given the difficult year-ago comparisons, but investors should also keep in mind that "steep" compares loom in the first quarter. Nevertheless, the sector is expected to remain hot throughout the year and consensus estimates for both companies reflect what the analyst described as a "reasonable" base-case scenarios. "We think the sector will remain a pocket of strength within retail given a still-favorable housing backdrop (turnover, home price appreciation, household formation), continued share gains, Pro initiatives, and omni/in-home selling efforts," Benedict wrote.
