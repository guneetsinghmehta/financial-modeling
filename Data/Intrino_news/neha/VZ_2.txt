<p>Aiming to diversify beyond the wireless handset market, <strong>Verizon Communications Inc</strong>. ( VZ ) announced Thursday a deal to acquire <strong>Skyward</strong>, a private drone company based in Portland, Ore., for an undisclosed sum. In a press release announcing the deal, <strong>Verizon</strong> said the acquisition of <strong>Skyward</strong> adds drone operations management to the wireless carrier&rsquo;s Internet of Things portfolio. With the handset market getting saturated, the four major telecom players have been looking for new growth areas and have been setting their sights on the market for connected devices, which is set to explode. According to Gartner Research , there will be 11.4 billion connected devices by 2018 with spending on IoT security alone forecast to reach $547 million in the same time frame. <strong>Verizon</strong> said <strong>Skyward</strong> manages drone operations internationally for companies, allowing improved safety and lower operating costs. With the deal, <strong>Verizon</strong> said businesses of all sizes will have a single source to integrate, manage and wirelessly connect their drone operations. "Last quarter we announced our strategy to drive innovation and widespread adoption for in-flight wireless connectivity through our Airborne LTE Operations (ALO) initiative, a new service to simplify certification and connectivity of wireless drones,&rdquo; said Mike Lanman, senior vice president for Enterprise Products and IoT at<strong> Verizon</strong>, in a press release announcing the deal. &ldquo;This acquisition is a natural progression of our core focus on operating in innovative, high-growth markets." With the addition of <strong>Skyward</strong>'s technology, <strong>Verizon</strong> said it will help companies with the management of drone operations via one platform that can handle all aspects of operating a drone from planning the mission to ensuring the drones are complaint with the Federal Aviation Authority. All of this, said <strong>Verizon</strong>, is aimed at helping developers and businesses create and manage a wide range of services on <strong>Verizon</strong>'s mobile private network. While all of the wireless carriers are eyeing the IoT and drone markets as the next bastions of growth, during 2016 <strong>Verizon</strong> was very active in the area, with market research firm <strong>Analysys Mason</strong> calling <strong>Verizon</strong> the boldest among the four carriers in a late-December report. During 2016, <strong>Verizon</strong> acquired <strong>Fleetmatics</strong>, <strong>Telogis</strong> and other smaller IoT firms. The research firm is predicting more deals this year with <strong>Verizon</strong> and its rivals acting as the IoT and drone suitors. &ldquo;Currently, revenue from IoT accounts for less than 1% of most operators&rsquo; total revenue. It will take until 2025 for IoT to exceed 5% of operators&rsquo; total revenue, even starting from 1% and growing by 20% per annum (assuming flat top-line revenues), which is roughly in line with current growth rates for operators&rsquo; IoT businesses,&rdquo; wrote <strong>Analysys Maso</strong>n in a recent research report. &ldquo;Senior management may view this as too long a timescale and some operators may explore acquisitions or investments as a result.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
