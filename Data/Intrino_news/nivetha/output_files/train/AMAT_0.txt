BREAKING: Dow, S P 500 Stay Down; Nasdaq Inches Into Positive Ground Need to register? Current subscribers register here . Apple hit a record high during the week, leading the Dow, S 500 and Nasdaq to fresh all-time levels. (Marco Rubino/Shutterstock) The Dow Jones industrial average and other major indexes hit record highs as President Trump made more noises about tax reform, while Fed chief Janet Yellen took a slightly hawkish stance. <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ) rose to an all-time best while fellow Dow stock <strong>Verizon Communications</strong> ( VZ ) returned to unlimited wireless plans.<strong> Kraft Heinz</strong> ( KHC ) is pursuing a mammoth deal for <strong>Unilever</strong> ( UN ). <strong>NetEase</strong> ( NTES ), <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> ( CSCO ) and <strong>NetApp</strong> ( NTAP ) rallied on earnings, while <strong>General Motors</strong> ( GM ) may sell its European unit Opel. The Dow industrials rose 1.4% as of late Friday morning, the Nasdaq composite 1.3% and the S P 500 adding 1.1%, all hitting new highs during the week. Apple was a key contributor to all the major indexes. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost. "Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise," Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly. Markets don't expect a March move but see a 50-50 move by May and a strong likelihood by June. Yellen warned against repealing financial regulations passed after the credit crisis. Meanwhile, retail sales and inflation data were stronger than expected, while small-business optimism hit a fresh 12-year high and the Philly Fed manufacturing index shot up to its strongest reading since 1984. RELATED: Worries over intensified wireless competition pressured phone company stocks after <strong>Verizon Communications</strong> ( VZ ) reintroduced unlimited data plans nearly six years after removing them. Verizon sought an edge over <strong>T-Mobile</strong> ( TMUS ) and <strong>Sprint</strong> ( S ) by offering high-definition video as part of unlimited data. <strong>T-Mobile</strong> quickly changed its offer to include HD video. Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. <strong>AT T</strong> ( T )opened unlimited wireless beyond <strong>DirecTV</strong> and <strong>U-verse</strong> customers. Analysts say industry consolidation could ease competition. Merger talks are expected to heat up when a government spectrum auctions ends, perhaps by late March. RELATED: <strong>T-Mobile</strong> ( TMUS ) on Feb. 14 reported Q4 profit and revenue that edged views. For 2017, it forecast branded postpaid subscriber additions of 2.9 million, below estimates. Analysts called the guidance conservative, though in any event <strong>T-Mobile</strong> will likely lead industry subscriber growth for the fourth year in a row in 2017. For the first time,<strong> T-Mobile</strong> provided free cash flow guidance. It forecast three-year FCF annual growth of 45% to 48%, or about $4.5 billion by 2019. RELATED: <strong>Apple</strong>, the top Dow industrials stock in 2017 , hit a record high of 136.27 on news reports related to its cash-return plans and the upcoming iPhone 8. <strong>Apple</strong> reportedly increased its order of OLED displays from Samsung for its 10th-anniversary smartphone, due out in September. CFO Luca Maestri said <strong>Apple</strong> would look to boost dividends and buybacks if the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, as expected under President Trump. RELATED: <strong>Kraft Heinz</strong> ( KHC ) said it will continue to pursue the European consumer and food products giant even though <strong>Unilever</strong> ( UN ) said the offer undervalued the company and sees no reason for further talks. A combination would be one of the largest of all time and create a global food giant. <strong>Kraft Heinz</strong>, which has been slashing costs to boost profit, and <strong>Unilever</strong> both rose Friday morning. Snacks giant <strong>Mondelez</strong> ( MDLZ ) fell. RELATED: <strong>Kraft Heinz</strong> To Pursue <strong>Unilever</strong> Despite Snub; <strong>Mondelez</strong>, <strong>General Mills</strong> Fall President Trump on Wednesday met with CEOs from <strong>Target</strong> ( TGT ), <strong>Gap</strong> ( GPS ), <strong>AutoZone</strong> ( AZO ) and other retailers, saying he would cut regulations and encouraging them to expand in the U.S. Trump also said a "massive" tax plan was coming "in the not-too-distant future." <strong>Target</strong>, afterward, warned that a GOP plan for a border adjustment tax as part of corporate tax reform would force them to "raise prices for American families on everyday essentials." That subject came up during the meeting, although it was unclear how much of a focus it was. RELATED: Warren Buffett's <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> ( BRKB ) gobbled up shares of <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ) in Q4, quadrupling its holdings, according to a regulatory filing. He also continued to fill up on <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> ( DAL ),<strong> American Airlines</strong> ( AAL ) and <strong>United Airlines</strong> ( UAL ). David Einhorn's <strong>Greenlight Capital</strong> also boosted its stake in <strong>Apple</strong>. <strong>Appaloosa</strong> cut its stake in the iPhone maker but hiked its stake in <strong>Southwest</strong> ( LUV ). George Soros took stakes in <strong>Facebook</strong> ( FB ),<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong> ( GS ) and <strong>Delta</strong>, but dropped <strong>United</strong>. Activist investor Trian Fund Management built up a $3.5 billion position in <strong>Procter Gamble</strong> ( PG ). RELATED: The Chinese mobile gaming giant late Wednesday reported Q4 earnings per American depositary receipt of $4.40 minus items on revenue of $1.74 billion, both well above the analyst consensus. Online game revenue rose 63% in local currency to $1.29 billion. <strong>NetEase</strong> said it added 40 mobile titles in 2016, and in December it announced 14 new PC and mobile games. <strong>NetEase</strong> licenses many games from <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> ( ATVI ), including "World of Warcraft" and "Overwatch." <strong>NetEase</strong> stock leapt 14% on Thursday to a record high after edging past a buy point earlier in the week. RELATED: In its fiscal Q2 ended Jan. 28, Cisco earned 57 cents per share minus items, flat from a year earlier but topping views by a penny. Revenue fell 2% to $11.58 billion, the fifth straight decline, but that beat expectations of $11.55 billion. <strong>Cisco's</strong> deferred revenue from software and subscriptions jumped 51% to $4 billion in fiscal Q2, a sign that its shift to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers is gaining momentum. <strong>Cisco</strong> shares rose 6.9% as of Friday morning, hitting their best levels since November 2007. RELATED: Chip gear maker <strong>Applied Materials</strong> ( AMAT ) earned 67 cents a share ex items in its fiscal Q1, up 158% year over year, on sales of $3.28 billion, up 45%. Analysts expected 66 cents and $3.27 billion. It was <strong>Applied Materials'</strong> fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales and EPS growth. For fiscal Q2, <strong>Applied Materials</strong> sees strong earnings and sales growth that are above Wall Street models.<strong> Applied Materials</strong> shares edged lower Thursday, but remain near 16-year highs. RELATED: Data storage systems provider <strong>NetApp</strong> reported earnings and guidance that topped views. Revenue of $1.4 billion edged past the consensus of $1.39 billion and was its first top-line growth in 13 quarters. <strong>NetApp</strong> rose 4.2% on Thursday, moving back above a 39.10 buy point from a cup base . RELATED: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries now sees non-OPEC supplies growing by 240,000 barrels per day, double it prior estimate, as drilling and investment pick up in the U.S. OPEC also said in its oil market report that its production fell by 890,200 bpd in January. Saudi Arabia had the biggest decline in output. U.S. crude stockpiles jumped by 9.5 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, well above analyst estimates. But stocks at the Cushing, Okla., hub were down. <strong>Diamondback Energy</strong> ( FANG ) reported Q4 results above Wall Street views and raised its full-year production outlook and capital-spending target. <strong>Devon Energy</strong> ( DVN ) also reported Q4 results above expectations. RELATED: Peugeot's parent, PSA Group, said it was in talks with <strong>General Motors</strong> ( GM ) about potentially acquiring the U.S. automaker's Opel division, which also includes the British Vauxhall brand. The deal would give PSA Group a 16% market share in Europe, second only to <strong>Volkswagen</strong> ( VLKAY ). GM has had trouble turning a profit at the unit and had a tentative deal in 2009 to sell it to Canada's <strong>Magna</strong>. RELATED: One big health insurance merger, between <strong>Aetna</strong> ( AET ) and <strong>Humana</strong> ( HUM ), is dead, while the other, between <strong>Anthem</strong> ( ANTM ) and <strong>Cigna</strong> ( CI ), broke out into a wrestling match. Federal judges blocked both deals earlier this year. <strong>Cigna</strong> sued <strong>Anthem</strong> for $13 billion in damages on top of a $1.85 billion breakup fee. But a judge blocked <strong>Cigna</strong> from ending the merger after <strong>Anthem</strong> countersued, arguing that <strong>Cigna</strong> has tried to sabotage the deal. <strong>Humana</strong>, which gets a $1 billion payment from <strong>Aetna</strong> for its trouble, moved on by announcing a stock buyback and saying it will exit the ObamaCare exchanges. <strong>Aetna's</strong> CEO said the ObamaCare exchanges are in a death spiral. And <strong>Molina Health</strong> ( MOH ) signaled it would likely exit the ObamaCare exchanges next year. <strong>UnitedHealth</strong> ( UNH ) tumbled Friday morning on news that the Justice Department is joining a whistleblower suit accusing the health insurer of overcharging Medicare Advantage by hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly billions of dollars. RELATED: DOJ Accuses UnitedHealth Of Overcharging Medicare Advantage <strong>Snap</strong> ( SNAP ), in an updated SEC filing, says it's looking to 200 million shares at a price range of 14 to 16 a share, raising roughly $3 billion. That would give it a valuation of $19.5 billion to $22.2 billion, below earlier reports that the Snapchat parent would seek $25 billion. Snapchat enjoys rapid revenue growth, but <strong>Facebook</strong> ( FB ) is successfully imitating Snapchat features, especially on its Instagram app. RELATED:<strong> U.S. Stee</strong>l ( X ) flirted with a buy point during the week while <strong>Steel Dynamics</strong> ( STLD ) and <strong>Nucor</strong> ( NUE ) and aluminum maker <strong>Alcoa</strong> ( AA ) jumped on reports that China is considering sweeping production cuts to combat smog. Reuters reported that China could slash steel capacity by at least half and aluminum capacity by 30% in certain months. Cement and aggregates firms, like steel companies, are expected to benefit from President Trump's infrastructure push, as well as a multibillion-dollar wall on the border, but that won't help 2017 results much.<strong> Martin Marietta Materials</strong> ( MLM ) on Tuesday missed fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates and gave a subdued 2017 outlook. RELATED: Las-Vegas-centric <strong>MGM Resorts International</strong> ( MGM ) turned profitable in Q4, reversing a year-earlier loss, but missed estimates, while revenue was in line. <strong>Melco Crown Entertainment</strong> ( MPEL ), which operates out of gaming hub Macau and elsewhere in Asia, topped views on sales but missed on EPS. Macau has been trying to recover after the Chinese government launched an anti-money-laundering crackdown. MGM fell 9.3% on Thursday to a three-month low. Melco fell 4.5% after briefly retaking a buy point in the morning. RELATED: <strong>ON Semiconductor</strong> ( ON ) rose 10.2% through Thursday, hitting its best levels since August 2000, after the chipmaker on Sunday reported adjusted EPS rose 53% and sales climbed 50%, both beating. Q1 guidance also was strong.<strong> Shopify</strong> ( SHOP ) hit a record high after the e-commerce platform provider reported Q4 earnings that topped views as revenue grew 86% to $130.4 million. Q1 revenue guidance was strong. <strong>Mobileye</strong> ( MBLY ) and <strong>Volkswagen</strong> ( VLKAY ) will partner in the development and deployment of self-driving cars.
