The Virgin Group founder put up a blog post with pictures and video of the ex-president kitesurfing off one of Branson s private islands in the British Virgin Islands. Branson writes that Obama, who s a native of Hawaii, told him he was prevented from surfing by his security detail during his time in office. Branson says after spending a couple days learning to kitesurf, Obama bested the billionaire in a watersport challenge. He says inviting the Obamas to his island was a huge honor. Obama spent his first days after leaving Washington vacationing in Palm Springs, California.
