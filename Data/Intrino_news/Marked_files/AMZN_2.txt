<p><strong>Amazon</strong>.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has been saved by the Census. Two weeks after issuing underwhelming fourth-quarter financials, the online retailer was vindicated by both poor reads for traditional retailers and a report by the U.S. Census Bureau, which highlighted Amazon&rsquo;s favorable market position. <strong>Amazon</strong> reported deceleration in U.S. commerce revenue growth across consecutive quarters, but, relative to competitors, the company is quickly and greedily gaining ground. &ldquo;Most large brick-and-mortar retailers have not reported yet, but all indications are for an especially weak Q4,&rdquo; MKM Managing Director Rob Sanderson wrote in a Thursday note. &ldquo;Some retail analysts are calling the season &lsquo;a disaster&rsquo; and the worst nonrecession Holiday in memory.&rdquo; Related Link: Why Wix Could Be A Major Threat To <strong>Amazon</strong> Meanwhile, Census data suggested acceleration of market share gain for <strong>Amazon</strong>, which currently maintains less than a 6 percent hold despite having outpaced industry growth for years. &ldquo;We see very significant growth headroom as AMZN drives to transition to online commerce and extends its competitive moat,&rdquo; Sanderson wrote. The company&rsquo;s position relative to competitors renders it &ldquo;the best longterm growth story available to investors today.&rdquo; MKM maintained a Buy rating and a $995 price target on <strong>Amazon</strong>.
