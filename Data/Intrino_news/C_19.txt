What Boosted The Benchmarks? Fed Chair Janet Yellen's first day testimony before Congress solidified the views that the Fed is more hawkish now. Yellen left the possibility of a rate hike open as early as the central bank's next policy meeting in March on Feb 14. Citing an improving economy and solid labor market, she noted that waiting too long to hike rates would be unwise since it might hamper the broader financial markets. She reiterated some of the language from the Fed's last policy meeting that adopted a more hawkish outlook, while indicating that she is concerned about the possibility of holding off rate hike for too long. Yellen expects gradual rate increases to occur amid a modestly expanding economy and inflation that should touch the Fed's desired target rate of 2% in the near term. She said that "at our upcoming meetings, the Fed will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line withâ€¦expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate". As Yellen signaled that the central bank could gradually raise interest rates sooner rather than later, financial stocks lead gains for the day, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) increasing 1.2% on Feb 14. The financial sector has rallied more than 20% since the November election, and 4.2% this month alone. Bank stocks jumped after Yellen's hawkish comments on interest rates. Higher longer-term interest rates can boost bank profits, as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.
