Apple hit a record high during the week, leading the Dow, S 500 and Nasdaq to fresh all-time levels. (Marco Rubino/Shutterstock) The Dow Jones industrial average and other major indexes hit record highs as President Trump made more noises about tax reform, while Fed chief Janet Yellen took a slightly hawkish stance. <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ) rose to an all-time best while fellow Dow stock Verizon Communications ( VZ ) returned to unlimited wireless plans. Kraft Heinz ( KHC ) is pursuing a mammoth deal for <strong>Unilever</strong> ( UN ). <strong>NetEase</strong> ( NTES ), <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> ( CSCO ) and <strong>NetApp</strong> ( NTAP ) rallied on earnings, while <strong>General Motors</strong> ( GM ) may sell its European unit <strong>Opel</strong>. The Dow industrials rose 1.4% as of late Friday morning, the Nasdaq composite 1.3% and the S P 500 adding 1.1%, all hitting new highs during the week. Apple was a key contributor to all the major indexes. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost. "Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise," Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly. Markets don't expect a March move but see a 50-50 move by May and a strong likelihood by June. Yellen warned against repealing financial regulations passed after the credit crisis. Meanwhile, retail sales and inflation data were stronger than expected, while small-business optimism hit a fresh 12-year high and the Philly Fed manufacturing index shot up to its strongest reading since 1984. RELATED: Worries over intensified wireless competition pressured phone company stocks after <strong>Verizon Communications</strong> ( VZ ) reintroduced unlimited data plans nearly six years after removing them. <strong>Verizon</strong> sought an edge over <strong>T-Mobile</strong> ( TMUS ) and <strong>Sprint</strong> ( S ) by offering high-definition video as part of unlimited data. <strong>T-Mobile</strong> quickly changed its offer to include HD video. Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. <strong>AT T</strong> ( T )opened unlimited wireless beyond DirecTV and U-verse customers. Analysts say industry consolidation could ease competition. Merger talks are expected to heat up when a government spectrum auctions ends, perhaps by late March. RELATED: <strong>T-Mobile</strong> ( TMUS ) on Feb. 14 reported Q4 profit and revenue that edged views. For 2017, it forecast branded postpaid subscriber additions of 2.9 million, below estimates. Analysts called the guidance conservative, though in any event <strong>T-Mobile</strong> will likely lead industry subscriber growth for the fourth year in a row in 2017. For the first time, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> provided free cash flow guidance. It forecast three-year FCF annual growth of 45% to 48%, or about $4.5 billion by 2019.

CFO Luca Maestri said <strong>Apple</strong> would look to boost dividends and buybacks if the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, as expected under President Trump. RELATED: Kraft Heinz ( KHC ) said it will continue to pursue the European consumer and food products giant even though <strong>Unilever</strong> ( UN ) said the offer undervalued the company and sees no reason for further talks. A combination would be one of the largest of all time and create a global food giant. Kraft Heinz, which has been slashing costs to boost profit, and <strong>Unilever</strong> both rose Friday morning. Snacks giant <strong>Mondelez</strong> ( MDLZ ) fell.

And <strong>Molina Health</strong> ( MOH ) signaled it would likely exit the ObamaCare exchanges next year. <strong>UnitedHealth</strong> ( UNH ) tumbled Friday morning on news that the Justice Department is joining a whistleblower suit accusing the health insurer of overcharging Medicare Advantage by hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly billions of dollars.
