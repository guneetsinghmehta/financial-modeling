President Donald Trump strongly supports the idea of relaxing regulatory burdens for the financial sector. Large banks with outstanding litigation cases could benefit from Trump’s stance in the form of lower expenses, balance sheet growth, and more capital. Trump also plans to boost infrastructure spending, which could result in a steepening yield curve and improved bank margins. Nearly half of the revenues generated by Bank of America and Wells Fargo are tied to interest rates, and these two banks ( XLF ) would be significant beneficiaries of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve. “There is this belief that the regulatory process is going to become much less onerous under Trump,” Compass Point Research Trading analyst Charles Peabody noted. “Since a lot of the problems at Wells Fargo were regulatory-induced, there is hope for some relief on that front.” Brian Gardner, head of Washington research at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, wrote in a note, “We think the main result of Donald Trump’s election will be that Trump will be able to appoint regulators who are more industry friendly than regulators appointed by President Obama.” Wells Fargo’s Wealth Management business is also expected to benefit from Trump’s proposed cut in tax rates. Investors expect a Trump presidency to be much friendlier to the financial sector. Specifically, banking regulations like the Dodd–Frank Act and stress tests meant to safeguard the broader economy have limited Bank of America’s capital return plans. If Trump is able to relax such regulations, Bank of America could raise its dividends to 4% and repurchase 5%–7% of its shares with its earnings. Bank of America is also currently trading at the steepest discount among its peers Wells Fargo ( WFC ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), and Goldman Sachs ( GS ). If Bank of America continues to improve its fundamentals while hiking dividends and buying back stock, its multiples could rise, leading to stock gains. Quote data by Xignite
