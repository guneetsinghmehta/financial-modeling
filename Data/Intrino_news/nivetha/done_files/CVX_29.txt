In one sense, they love it, having so called the Business Policy Counsel,&rdquo; said Bill George, a faculty at Harvard business School and a CNBC Contributor, in a CNBC report. &ldquo;But on the other hand, they are all afraid of his tweets. They want to kind of carry favor and many of them are stepping forward.&rdquo; Here are some CEOs that mentioned President Trump either in their conference calls regarding their Q4 earnings or interviews with the press. <strong>American Electric Power</strong> AEP &ndash; Nicholas K. Akins &ldquo;President Trump&rsquo;s focus of enhancing the ability for manufacturing industries to thrive and produce jobs, well, that&rsquo;s AEP&rsquo;s service territory.

So I&rsquo;m encouraged by his engagement. His approach to engaging business, having an open dialogue, discussing the issues, finding solutions, finding ways to grow U.S. manufacturing jobs I think are all very positive. And that engagement is a productive approach. We welcome it.

CME Group CME &ndash; Terrence A. Duffy &ldquo;I also think what&rsquo;s interesting for 2017 is&hellip; some of the European elections that we&rsquo;re going to see in 2017. As you know, we get a tremendous amount of revenue coming out of Europe. And that is something that, with the elections coming up, I believe in Germany and France this year both, it could be another volatile situation. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s going to be the same as when President Trump was elected, but that&rsquo;s something that we could look at. So I think geopolitical volatility could be definitely in the mix&hellip;&rdquo; Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings is the largest futures exchange in the U.S. based on notional value, trading volume and open interest.

We have seen an avalanche of regulation over the last decade, and putting a much more balanced cost/benefit framework in place to assess the value those regulations, freeing up infrastructure pipelines, all of that is quite positive for our business, for the country, job creation, and a lot of things. So that is very much a positive.&rdquo; Chevron, the energy company, is regaining after a slight fall towards the end of January 2017. The company is currently at $112.75 with a 0.2% increase.
