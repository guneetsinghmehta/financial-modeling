Houston (AP) -- Of the five Super Bowl rings Robert Kraft has earned as owner of the New England Patriots, one of them has an unlikely owner: Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kraft took part in a recent NFL Network series of interviews about Super Bowl rings and retold a story about his ring from 2005 s Super Bowl 39. He says he was on a business trip to Russia later that year when he showed the ring to Putin. Kraft says Putin put on the ring and didn t give it back. A Putin spokesman said in 2013 that the ring was a gift and the Russian leader would send Kraft a replacement if he wanted. The spokesman says Kraft s ring is on display at the Kremlin. ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
