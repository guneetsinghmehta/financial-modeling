At Holdings Channel , we have reviewed the latest batch of the 22 most recent 13F filings for the 12/31/2016 reporting period, and noticed that Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD) was held by 8 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look. Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen . makeArticleAd(); Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in HD positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers: Fund New Position?

We then compared that number to the sum total of HD shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2016 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for HD.
