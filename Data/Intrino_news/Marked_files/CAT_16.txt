For 57% stocks that advanced, 39% declined. What Boosted The Benchmarks? In a meeting with members of the airline industry at the White House on Feb 9, Trump said that his goal for lowering taxes, especially for business was moving "ahead of schedule". Trump's latest announcements raised expectations of a low tax environment, which in turn had a positive impact on the broader markets, in particular, financial stocks. Expectations over such policies have quelled concerns regarding his protectionist approach to trade and his controversial attempts to check immigration. Additionally, there exists a significant lack of clarity regarding the exact shape of his policy measures. However, Trump's indications of upcoming tax reforms have benefited financials immensely. Banks have been the prime beneficiaries of the rally which began right after election results were announced. This is because investors think that they stand to benefit substantially in a higher rate environment, accompanied by likely deregulation from the Trump administration. Additionally, industrials have increased following rising expectations of a step-up in infrastructure spending, which is likely to raise demand for the sector's products. In keeping with these sentiments, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) increased 1.1%, emerging as the highest gainer among the S P 500's industrial sectors. Dow components <strong>Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.</strong> ( GS ) and <strong>JPMorgan Chase Co.</strong> ( JPM ) gained 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and <strong>JPMorgan</strong> possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Of its components, <strong>Caterpillar Inc.</strong> ( CAT ) gained 2.3%, emerging as the highest gainer for the Dow. Meanwhile, a meeting between Trump and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudea left markets largely unmoved. This is a significant development given the extent of the differences among the two leaders on a variety of issues, such as climate change and immigration. It is also a welcome one given the volume of trade between the two countries. Additionally, investors await Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee later today. It is widely expected that the Fed Chair will reemphasize that central bank maintains a cautious approach to monetary policy.
