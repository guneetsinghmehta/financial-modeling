According to a January 26, 2017, Reuters report citing unknown sources, Verizon ( VZ ) could be more interested in acquiring Charter Communications ( CHTR ) than Comcast ( CMCSA ). According to the report, Charter and Verizon refused to comment on the rumor. However, potential hurdles to a Verizon-Charter deal include regulatory review risks and the large sizes of both companies, including their respective debt loads: ~$108.0 billion for Verizon and $60.2 billion for Charter. In addition, market overlap in key markets such as the New York City area would need to be considered. Additionally, the Department of Justice will likely take a hard look at the deal from an antitrust perspective under the administration of President Donald Trump, who, during his campaign, expressed concerns about media consolidation. In October 2016, during the election, Trump stated at a rally that if elected, he would be reluctant to approve the intended takeover of Time Warner ( TWX ) by AT T (T). The president is said to believe that the deal would lead to too much concentration in the media industry. Charter acquired Time Warner Cable for ~$60 billion in 2016. The Department of Justice approved the deal, as it didn’t view the scale of the merged company as sufficient to tip the market in the way a Comcast–Time Warner Cable combination would have. AT T’s acquisition of satellite TV provider DIRECTV for ~$49 billion received regulatory approval after more than a year of review. Through its DIRECTV acquisition, AT T has become the leading pay-TV player in the United States with 25.3 million subscribers, surpassing Comcast’s subscriber base. Comcast’s acquisition of a 51% stake in NBCUniversal for ~$39 billion from General Electric ( GE ) was approved by the Federal Communications Commission after a 13-month review. Comcast, a leading cable distributor, wanted to own entertainment and news cable channels. Quote data by Xignite
