Boeing may find it easier to sell 787 Dreamliners from its factory in South Carolina if President Trump approves funding for the Export-Import Bank. (<strong>Boeing</strong>) The Export Import Bank might have full lending powers again as President Trump is expected to make an announcement about the agency at <strong>Boeing</strong> 's ( BA ) factory in South Carolina on Friday. The federal export credit agency was closed for six months after its charter expired on June 30, 2015, before opening back up with limited authority. Boeing, <strong>General Electric</strong> ( GE ), <strong>Caterpillar</strong> ( CAT ) and other beneficiaries have been pushing for re-establishing a quorum on the bank's board allowing it to make deals greater than $10 million. <strong>Boeing</strong> shares ticked up 0.5% to 169.30 on the stock market today . GE shares inched up 0.2% to 30.35. <strong>Caterpillar</strong> shares climbed 1% to 99.02. In the past few years, the bank helped <strong>Boeing</strong> sell its 787 Dreamliners to India, Poland and Ethiopia, and GE sell its trains to Pakistan. <strong>Caterpillar</strong> also relies on the bank to sell its heavy equipment overseas. A <strong>Boeing</strong> spokesperson told <strong>Bloomberg</strong> that without the bank, U.S. firms are at a "significant competitive disadvantage" vs. rivals overseas like <strong>Airbus</strong> ( EADSY ). The bank only authorized $5 billion in financing in fiscal 2016, down from $20 billion in 2014. It was started 80 years ago in response to the Great Depression and helps facilitate foreign companies' efforts to buy U.S. goods. <strong>Boeing</strong> is the largest beneficiary, with 40% of all authorizations in 2014 going to the aerospace giant, according to George Mason University's Mercatus Center analysts, who were quoted in a <strong>Bloomberg</strong> story. Democrats are the bank's biggest supporters and President Obama wanted to expand its lending limit from $140 billion to $160 billion. Trump had initially been opposed to the Ex-Im Bank but <strong>Boeing</strong> Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg may have swayed Trump as the two have had several talks after Trump blasted the costs of <strong>Boeing's</strong> Air Force One contract. Trump's support of the bank would go against Republican members in Congress who believe the bank is crony capitalism set to favor big companies with their hands in politics. <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> ' ( DAL ) former CEO Richard Anderson was an outspoken opponent of the bank during his time at the airline, arguing that the Ex-Im Bank helped subsidize orders to wealthy Middle Eastern carriers like Dubai's Emirates with U.S. taxpayer dollars. Airbus ticked up less than 0.3% to 17.52. <strong>Delta</strong> tacked on 2.6% to 51.17.
