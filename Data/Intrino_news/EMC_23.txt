Earlier in the series, we saw that the market has more optimism for VMware ( VMW ) stock. Let’s see now whether EMC ( EMC ) finally becoming part of Dell will impact VMware. EMC ( EMC ) has an 80.0% stake and 97.0% voting rights in VMware. In early 2016, VMware provided a weak 2016 guidance due to the distractions posed by the impending Dell-EMC  deal. With Dell’s purchase of EMC, Dell not only got EMC and VMware but also RSA Security, a cybersecurity company; Pivotal Software, a software-development company; and Virtustream, a cloud software company. Later in the series, we’ll see how the Dell-EMC merger could pose a threat to Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ), Cisco ( CSCO ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) in the cloud space. Clarifying its position with Dell, VMware, in its 3Q16 earnings release, “announced a transition to the Dell fiscal year beginning on February 4, 2017. The first quarter for fiscal 2018 will begin on February 4 and end on May 5, 2017.” In its recent  3Q16 earnings release , VMware “announced the formation of a new Products and Cloud Services organization focused on extending VMware’s leadership across compute, storage, networking, management and business mobility. Raghu Raghuram and Rajiv Ramaswami will co-lead this new organization and take on expanded roles as Chief Operating Officers, Products and Cloud Services.” Quote data by Xignite
