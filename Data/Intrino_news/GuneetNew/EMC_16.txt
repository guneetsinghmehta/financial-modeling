<p>Earlier, we discussed how<strong> Sanovi Technologies</strong> could enhance IBM&rsquo;s position in the hybrid cloud space. Let&rsquo;s see how Sanovi would complement <strong>IBM&rsquo;s</strong> &ldquo;disaster recovery strategy.&rdquo; We know that <strong>Sanovi Technologies</strong> would be integrated into IBM<strong>&rsquo;</strong>s Resiliency Services, including DRaaS (disaster recovery as a service) and BaaS (backup-as-a-service). In June 2016, <strong>IBM</strong> was positioned as a leader in Gartner&rsquo;s Magic Quadrant for DRaaS for the second straight year. Gartner expects that from 2016 to 2020, the use of either IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) or DRaaS &ldquo;to support the failover of production applications will grow by more than 200%.&rdquo; Through its acquisition of <strong>Sanovi Technologies</strong>, <strong>IBM</strong> intends to expand its Disaster Recovery Services to its Hybrid Cloud offerings. Martin Jetter, senior vice president of <strong>IBM&rsquo;s</strong> Global Technology Services, stated, &ldquo;As a cloud-native company, <strong>Sanovi</strong> will strengthen our resiliency portfolio to manage the broad range of applications, data, and IT systems of our clients balancing digital and hybrid cloud transformation with increased regulatory compliance.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s see why we expect significant growth in the disaster, backup, and recovery space. <strong>Salesforce</strong>.com ( CRM ) estimates that over 90% of the world&rsquo;s data have been generated in the last two years. The number of connected devices is projected to reach 75 billion by 2020. If we consider <strong>EMC</strong> ( <strong>EMC</strong> ) estimates, by 2020, the digital universe will grow 300 times, from the present 130 exabytes to 40,000 exabytes. With such an explosion in data, the need for a backup and disaster recovery process can&rsquo;t be ruled out. This explains technology players <strong>IBM&rsquo;s</strong> and <strong>Microsoft&rsquo;s</strong> ( MSFT ) billion dollar investments and strategic focuses on the machine-learning space.
