<strong>Charter Communications Inc</strong>. CHTR, the second largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in the U.S., recently announced that the company is launching experimental field trials of the upcoming 5G wireless network. Notably, these trials come on the back of spectrum test licenses granted to the company by the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. telecom regulator. The news immediately gave rise to the speculation that the U.S. telecom behemoth <strong>Verizon Communications Inc</strong>. VZ is exploring strategic options to acquire the cable MSO. Notably, <strong>Charter Communications</strong> has an agreement with <strong>Verizon</strong> to operate as a mobile virtual network operator using the latters wireless network. A combination of<strong> Verizon</strong> and <strong>Charter Communications</strong> will bring together<strong> Verizon</strong>s 114.243 million wireless subscribers, 4.694 million FiOS video subscribers and 5.653 million FiOS Internet subscribers with <strong>Charter Communications</strong> more than 17 million video customers and 22.5 million high-speed Internet customers. Last year, <strong>Charter Communications</strong> became a giant cable MSO after its acquisition of <strong>Time Warner Cable</strong> and<strong> BrightHouse LLC</strong>. <strong>Verizon</strong> is facing intensifying competitive pressure in the U.S. wireless market due to cut-throat pricing pressure from smaller players like <strong>T-Mobile US Inc</strong>. TMUS and <strong>Sprint Corp</strong>. S. In the fourth quarter of 2016, total revenue of the company decreased 5.6% year over year to $32,340 million. <strong>Verizon</strong> added 0.591 million postpaid customers (down 61.1% year over year) while prepaid customer count decreased by 0.009 million. We believe a merger with <strong>Charter Communications</strong> makes sense for<strong> Verizon</strong> since the company is aiming to launch initial version of the upcoming super-fast 5G network in 2017. 5G services require connections to have fiber-optic networks in dense urban areas. <strong>Charter Communications</strong> would aid <strong>Verizon</strong> standardize 5G network from a technical perspective. The combined entity will also acquire a powerful position to plot a course in the future of pay-TV industry as they change during that technical evolution. Price Performance of <strong>Charter Communications</strong> 2016 was extremely good for <strong>Charter Communications</strong> investors. In the last one year, the stock returned 69.83%, outshining the Zacks categorized Cable TV industrys gain of 37.91%. Nevertheless, cable TV industry is facing massive cord-cutting threat and<strong> Charter Communications</strong> is no exception to the trend. We believe that is the primary reason behind the stock currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of todays Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .
