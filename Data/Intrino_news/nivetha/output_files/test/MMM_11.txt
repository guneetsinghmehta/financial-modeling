U.S. bourses hit yet another high on Friday and logged in the third weekly gain. In particular, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the biggest beneficiary of the rotation in leadership in the large cap domestic space. The index topped the 20,000 milestone for the first time on January 25 and then retreated on concerns over Trumps protectionist action and lack of clarity on policy reforms. However, the optimism returned in the last couple of days following Trumps talks of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. This reignited a post-election rally that is expected to continue on renewed hopes that Trump is acting on his pro-growth promises. Further, the continuation of friendly U.S. and Japan trade ties thanks to an amicable Trump-Abes meeting has eased nervousness relating to the currency policy, which dominated the market for weeks. With this, the President put his focus back on boosting economic growth and a strong dollar. Trump has already enacted a slew of his proposed reforms including deregulation. This has bolstered confidence and increased investors risk appetite. Another major catalyst is solid corporate Q4 earnings. As per the latest Earnings Preview, the Q4 earnings season is faring better than recent years with not only earnings growth set to reach the highest level in two years but total earnings for the quarter on track to hit a new record, surpassing the previous record achieved in Q4 of 2014.
