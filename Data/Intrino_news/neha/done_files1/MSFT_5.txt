<strong>Amazon</strong> ( AMZN ) has its work cut out for it in the cloud. <strong>Microsoft</strong> ( MSFT ), <strong>Alphabet</strong>s ( GOOGL ) <strong>Google</strong>,<strong> Oracle</strong> ( ORCL ), and I<strong>nternational Business Machines</strong> ( IBM ) have all been announcing competitive threats against <strong>Amazon</strong> Web Services (or AWS), raising concerns about the position and prospects of <strong>Amazon</strong>s cloud business. Yet cloud operations have become a key profitability driver at <strong>Amazon</strong>. <strong>Amazon</strong>s 4Q16 offered aglimpse into the toughening competition in the cloud computing market as AWS growth slowed. The company reported AWS revenue of $3.5 billion, although that indicated a growth of 47% YoY (year-over-year), the growth slowed from 55% YoY in the prior quarter. Furthermore, the reported revenue missed the consensus estimate that called for cloud revenue of $3.6 billion. Recently during the companys 2Q17 earnings call,<strong>Microsoft</strong>s CEO Satya Nadella offered a glimpse into how the company intends to keep <strong>Amazon</strong> from its traditional enterprise strongholds. <strong>Microsoft</strong> believes that <strong>Amazon</strong> doesnt have expertise in the business of selling software and services to corporations. As such, while AWS is a credible competitor in the cloud infrastructure space, <strong>Microsoft</strong> believes Azure can hold <strong>Amazon</strong> in software-as-a-service (or SaaS) and other cloud adjacencies where AWS is likely to struggle to gain ameaningful foothold. <strong>Oracle</strong> also recently announced plans to open several cloud regions this year, escalating competition for the cloud computing market. On its part, <strong>Google</strong> is pushing hard against <strong>Amazon</strong>, and last year it succeeded in persuading <strong>Apple</strong> ( AAPL ) to move a portion of its cloud operations from AWS to <strong>Google</strong> Cloud. Being the cloud leader, <strong>Amazon</strong> has the most to lose if its rivals succeed in their efforts.
