<p>The potential acquisition of <strong>Charter Communications</strong> ( CHTR ) could be seen as another attempt by <strong>Verizon</strong> ( VZ ) to pursue revenue growth outside its traditional carrier business, in which competition has become more intense. Smaller carriers <strong>T-Mobile</strong> ( TMUS ) and <strong>Sprint</strong> (S) have stepped up the competition for subscribers via aggressive pricing techniques. Through a <strong>Charter</strong> acquisition,<strong> Verizon</strong> could grow to be the size of<strong> AT T</strong> (T), with ~60 million home passings. If<strong> Verizon</strong> does acquire <strong>Charter</strong>, the combination could also create a strong competitor for <strong>Comcast</strong> ( CMCSA ) in the 5G (fifth-generation) technology and US pay-TV spaces. Earlier, through its DIRECTV acquisition, <strong>AT T</strong> became the leading pay-TV player in the United States. After this deal, at the end of 4Q16, AT T&rsquo;s US pay-TV subscriber base reached 25.3 million, surpassing <strong>Comcast</strong>&rsquo;s subscriber base. <strong>Comcast</strong> stood in second place at 22.5 million pay-TV subscribers. <strong>Charter</strong> ranked third with ~16.9 million pay-TV subscribers. However, according to reports, pay-TV providers such as <strong>Verizon</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, and <strong>Charter</strong> are currently losing customers to online video streaming companies via a phenomenon known as cord-cutting. The over-the-top (or OTT) video streaming market has huge growth potential. Users have been subscribing to OTT services in greater numbers than ever before, mainly due to the high monthly bills that users are paying cable and satellite TV providers. A 3Q16 report from Digitalsmiths suggests that ~35.0% of users pay more than $100 every month to their pay-TV providers. The online video streaming market in the United States is crowded. Currently, the major players in the market are <strong>Netflix</strong> ( NFLX ), <strong>DISH TV</strong>&rsquo;s ( DISH ) Sling TV, and <strong>Sony</strong>&rsquo;s ( SNE ) PlayStation Vue.
